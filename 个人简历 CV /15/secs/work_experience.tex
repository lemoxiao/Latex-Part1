    				\begin{itemize}
              \item Title: a digital-intensive wakeup timer based on an RC frequency-locked loop for Internet of Things (IoT) applications
    					\item Proposed a novel ultra-low-power oscillator architecture to fully exploit the small area and low supply voltage advantages in advanced CMOS processes
              \item System-level modeling with MATLAB to estimate stabilities of the oscillator w.r.t. temperature, supply and noise
              \item Transistor-level implementation in Cadence and tape-out in TSMC 40-nm CMOS
              \item Measurements show the oscillator has the lowest supply voltage, the highest energy efficiency, and comparable stabilities w.r.t. the state-of-the-art

    				\begin{itemize}
              \item Explored control algorithms in smart car systems
    					\item Adapted the Kalman Filter into the navigation system of the car using data from multiple sensors, e.g., gyroscope and accelerometer
              \item Collaborated with other colleagues in the PCB design of the hardware
