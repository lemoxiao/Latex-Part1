            implementing a framework that is used by other developers to reduce implementation time.\ In fact, I had a crucial role in designing architecture model and
            implementing several APIs for batch processing.\ I also designed and implemented some important banks’ functional requirements such as lending overnight calculation.

            Lending conversion project, which aimed to migrate all information from Negin CORE Banking Solution into Lotus CORE Banking Solution,
            started actively in March 2011.\ I was designated as the superior and architect in order to design and implement the project.\ Inherently
            critical constraints such as gradual data migration in several phases and live migration without disruption had to be done accurately, which
            made it difficult to implement the project.\ The conversion project composed of multi-threaded Spring Batch and PL-SQl routines.\ The project
            was utilized in three operational phases successfully without any faults.
