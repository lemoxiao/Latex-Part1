I am extremely interested in the position of \jobTitle with
\companyName.

I would treasure the opportunity to be able to work at a fast paced company
where many different tasks are required for each individual.  Also, as a US
citizen I would need a sponsored visa to be able to work in London.  Relocating
is not a problem for me. I do have experience with Python through my university,
I co-taught a intro to Python class with a professor for two semesters.

I am a creative, yet focused, professional with strong software engineering
skills.  My knowledge of algorithms and design patterns has enabled me to
implement complicated programs with large amounts of data parsing.  For example,
In my last semester of undergrad, I created a bus tracker iOS app for my school.
 Students were then able to view the bus schedule, maps of the route, and set
 reminders of when to catch their bus.  I am an intrapeneur who aims to promote
 creative thinking and product development inside my organization.

Verbal and written communication are two of my strengths.
For the last four years I have managed a Youtube channel explaining programming
concepts.  Doing so consisted of writing notes to accompany my videos,
answering questions to promote community engagement, and refining my abilities
through listening to criticism. 

The programming and planning perspective required for a \jobTitle  position
align with my abilities and experiences.  I am enthusiastic about expanding my
knowledge of programming, and embarking on new challenges.  In addition, I
believe I have a lot to offer \companyName \ in terms of programming expertise and
I am excited about the prospect of working for you.

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to meeting you to discuss how
I can support the mission of \companyName.
