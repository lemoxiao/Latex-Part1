abstract = "Actual milling operations are sometimes accompanied by the cutter runout of the cutting edges, which is induced by the tool clamping error. The cutter runout brings about unequal cutting forces loaded on the cutting edges. Then, different wear rates of the cutting edges reduce the tool life. Therefore, the cutting forces in milling with the cutter runout should be analyzed to perform the milling operation properly. The paper presents an analytical model to evaluate the effect of the cutter runout on the cutting force. In the force model, three-dimensional chip flow in milling is interpreted as a piling up of the orthogonal cuttings in the planes containing the cutting velocities and the chip flow velocities. The chip flow direction is determined to minimize the cutting energy. In order to consider the cutter runout, the eccentricity of the center of the tool rotation is included in the coordinate system. Then, the cutting force loaded on each edge is simulated with the rotation radius of edge. The cutting tests were conducted to validate the presented force model. The cutting forces are measured with the cutter runout artificially controlled in the tests. The simulated cutting forces are compared with measured one. The effect of the cutter runout on the cutting force is studied in the simulation."

A simplified cutter runout model, which characterizes the effect of cutter axis offset and tilt on the undeformed chip geometry, has been formulated. A model building procedure based on experimentally measured average forces and the associated runout data is developed to identify the numerical values of the empirical model parameters for the particular workpiece/cutter combination."

The inclusion of tool wear is required when developing the process plans for a part, as the realistic cutting forces experienced during the full operation must be considered. The total cutting force is considered as the summation of the forces from the rake face, cutting edge, and flank face, where the flank force is defined as a function of the flank wear. The in-cut cutting edge is divided into infinitesimal segments, and for each segment the differential forces are computed. Summing up the differential forces of the in-cut infinitesimal segments forms the instantaneous cutting forces. The empirical tool wear model of the cutting edge is based on wear measurements made at one-degree increments around the ball of the cutting-edge angle within the in-cut region of the tool. A systematic model calibration procedure for calibrating the force coefficients of the rake face, cutting edge, and flank face was developed. The validation of the approach was performed using a finishing operation on hardened H13 die steel with uncoated tungsten carbide inserts."

A specific advantage of the present work is highlighted by deriving analytical expressions for sensitivity coefficients required to analytically propagate the uncertainty in the cutting-force model parameters. Another advantage is that even very small radial immersions can be used to derive cutting coefficients reliably, along with their variances. The aforementioned analytical investigations are applied to a series of experimental cutting tests to estimate the force-model cutting coefficients. Experimental investigations include the study of a tool having radial runout. Finally, confidence intervals are placed on predicted forces which experimentally verify the validity of the proposed force model."

abstract = "How to consider the mass loading effects and stiffness modification effects of materials removed on dynamic characteristics in a thin-walled component milling process is an essential problem. Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula can be employed and extended to estimate the corrected frequency response function (FRFs) without the material removing effect. In the paper, a novel method, named as structural dynamic modification method with equal mass, to predict the dynamic stable lobe diagram (DSLD) of the thin-walled workpiece milling process is proposed. The whole cutting process is divided into multi-cutting steps with equal length. The presented method is to regard material removal of each cutting step as a modification (or reanalysis) of structure so as to estimate the corrected FRFs based on the so-called Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula. The input data of the method is only two sets of the dynamic characteristics of original (unmachined) and finial (machined) structures, which can be easily obtained using experimental modal analysis (EMA) or finite element method (FEM). The accuracy of the method is dependent of the number of cutting step. FEM is highly recommended, and EMA mainly enables the damping ratio of FEM model to be readjusted. The efficiency is higher than one of the methods reported in literatures because it is not necessary to re-build and re-mesh FEM model each time, and the modal analysis can be implemented automatically through pre-programs. Meanwhile, using Sherman–Morrison–Woodbury formula at active coordinates only can greatly improve computational efficiency. Additionally, the probability of singularity occurring is very low comparing with that in the existing methods. Once the dynamic characteristics changing with respect to tool positions are identified, a specific DSLD can then be predicted by using these characteristics along the machining direction. And the cutting parameters for thin-walled components milling can be also optimized to avoid chatter vibration and improve the chatter-free material removal rate and surface finish. Finally, the results are verified by dynamic and milling tests with thin-walled workpiece."

An alternative response to the chip evacuation problem is the use of a vibratory drilling head, which enables the chip to be split thanks to the axial self-excited drill, and hence it can easily be evacuated from the hole. The vibratory drilling head is composed of a specific tool holder with adjustable axial stiffness. In this paper, a dynamic high-speed spindle/drilling head/tool system model is elaborated on the basis of rotor dynamics predictions. The dynamic properties of interfaces between system components are identified by the receptance coupling method and integrated into the model. The model is validated by comparing the numerical FRF with experimental results. Then adequate self-vibratory cutting conditions are established by integrating the model-based tool tip FRF into the chatter approach of Budak–Altintas. Spindle rolling bearing lifespan is also investigated in order to guarantee a rational use of the spindle-tool set with respect to industrial lifespan."

abstract = "In order to achieve higher productivity and product quality simultaneously for sculptured surface productions, two advanced strategies are proposed for machining planning, namely a cutting-path-adaptive-feedrate strategy and a control surface strategy. In the cutting-path-adaptive-feedrate strategy, machining time is reduced by cutting along low-force-low-error machining directions and by maximizing feedrates. In the control surface strategy, machining errors are minimized by using a compensated control surface based on predicted machining errors. In part 1 of this paper, the cutting-path-adaptive-feedrate strategy, which improves the productivity of sculptured surface machining when subjected to both force and dimensional constraints, is described. In this proposed strategy, a new machining-planning aid called a maximum feedrate map is developed. In this map, the maximum allowable feedrates, subjected to the specified constraints, at each control point along various machining directions, are determined using a surface generation model. These local maximum-feedrate boundaries indicate the acceptable range of feedrates that a part programmer can use in the NC programming. In addition, the maximum feedrate map also provides the part programmer an important aid in selecting the cutting directions. In order to illustrate the application of the maximum feedrate map and to examine the capability of the proposed cutting-path-adaptive-feedrate strategy in improving the productivity of sculptured surface machining, simulation studies of a two-dimensional curved surface are performed and the results are presented in this paper. The applications of the proposed strategy to real three-dimensional complex surfaces (e.g. a turbine blade die) along with experimental verifications are presented in part 2 of this paper. In part 3 of this paper the control surface strategy and its applications to the finish milling of three-dimensional complex surfaces are discussed."

The steel flexible structure is excited close to the free end with a shaker and may come into contact with a deformable and dissipative obstacle. A technique for modeling contact phenomena using piece-wise linear dynamics is applied. A finite-dimensional modal model is developed through a Galerkin projection. Concentrated masses, dampers and forces are considered in the equations of motion in such a way that the boundary conditions are those of a cantilever beam. Numerical studies are conducted by assuming finite-time contact duration to investigate the frequency response of the impacted beam for different driving frequencies. Experimental results have been extrapolated through a displacement laser sensor and a load cell. The comparison between numerical and experimental results show many qualitative and quantitative similarities. The novelty of this paper can be synthetized in (a) the development of experimental results that are in good agreement with the numerical implementation of the introduced model; (b) the development of a comprehensive contact model of the beam with an unilateral, deformable and dissipative obstacle located close to the tip; (c) the possibility of accounting for higher modes for the cantilever beam problem, and hence of analyzing how the response varies when moving the excitation (and/or the obstacle) along the beam, and of investigating the effect of the linearly elastic deformability of the built‐in end of the beam; (d) an easy and intuitive solution to the problem of accounting for spatially singular masses, dampers, springs and forces in the motion equations; (e) the possibility of accounting for finite gap and duration of the contact between beam and obstacle."

Like any other manufacturing techniques, machining produces many by-products or wastes including metal chips/swarf impregnated with cutting fluid, spent cutting fluid, oil contaminated water, oil mist, metal dust, and unnecessary energy usage. These wastes have major consequences for health, the environment, productivity, and manufacturing costs. In recent years, owing to the increasing social awareness of health and environmental issues, new and tighter legislations are being introduced in order to minimize the impact on the environment, hence creating a more sustainable world. Machining industries are also being forced to reduce their impacts on environment through legislation introduced by both government and international bodies.

abstract = "Unit operations and product design are the two most important pillars of chemical engineering. Product design is the formation, formulation, handling, manufacturing, and characterization of complex multiphase products with specific properties and is thus at the core of mesoscale science and engineering. The applications define the required product properties which cover both classical fields of process technology in the chemical industry as well as new emerging fields of electronics, energy and environmental technologies, life sciences, materials science and engineering, nanotechnology, and photonic technologies highlighting the broad relevance of mesoscale science. Unifying principles of product design are proposed which are widely applicable to many different kinds of products including solid, liquid, and even gaseous particles. Results from the Erlangen Cluster of Excellence “Engineering of Advanced Materials” show that the joint venture of chemical engineering with materials science in concert with the basic sciences opens new prospects for all involved disciplines. In particular, chemical and biochemical engineering expands through particle technologies also in physics-related fields of technology such as electronics, photonics, or 3D printing. Rigorous mathematical optimization methods based on predictive models for products, structures, and processes catalyze new possibilities for true design of particulate products which is at the core of mesoscale science and technology."

abstract = "The design and manufacturing of dies and molds represent a significant link in the entire production chain because nearly all mass produced discrete parts are formed using production processes that employ dies and molds. Thus, the quality, cost and lead times of dies and molds affect the economics of producing a very large number of components, subassemblies and assemblies, especially in the automotive industry. Therefore, die and mold makers are forced to develop and implement the latest technology in: part and process design including process modeling, rapid prototyping, rapid tooling, optimized tool path generation for high speed cutting and hard machining, machinery and cutting tools, surface coating and repair as well as in EDM and ECM. This paper, prepared with input from many CIRP colleagues, attempts to review the significant advances and practical applications in this field."

abstract = "Electromagnetic forming is an impulse or high-speed forming technology using pulsed magnetic field to apply Lorentz’ forces to workpieces preferably made of a highly electrically conductive material without mechanical contact and without a working medium. Thus hollow profiles can be compressed or expanded and flat or three-dimensionally preformed sheet metal can be shaped and joined as well as cutting operations can be performed. Due to extremely high velocities and strain rates in comparison to conventional quasistatic processes, forming limits can be extended for several materials. In this article, the state of the art of electromagnetic forming is reviewed considering:•basic research work regarding the process principle, significant parameters on the acting loads, the resulting workpiece deformation, and their interactions, and the energy transfer during the process;•application-oriented research work and applications in the field of forming, joining, cutting, and process combinations including electromagnetic forming incorporated into conventional forming technologies. Moreover, research on the material behavior at the process specific high strain rates and on the equipment applied for electromagnetic forming is regarded. On the basis of this survey it is described why electromagnetic forming has not been widely initiated in industrial manufacturing processes up to now. Fields and topics where further research is required are identified and prospects for future industrial implementation of the process are given."

abstract = "Machine tools need to work accurately and highly dynamically to keep up with the requirements of modern machining processes. Besides the technical issues, time to market is too short to build a real prototype in future. This leads to the necessity for a method which enables the forecast of the future machine performance. To predict the machining results exactly, large movements on flexible structures have to be calculated. With the specific integration of FEA and MBS for the domain of machine tools it is possible to predict the dynamic machine behaviour. The simulation system is based on the relative nodal method for large deformation problems. A model of a machine tool with all relevant components was simulated and matched with experiments to demonstrate the approach."
