	电声脉冲法( PEA) 测量原理
	
	PEA
	
	[ 11,12] 的基本原理是: 在介质电极上加上一
	
	个窄高压脉冲, 则介质中的空间电荷和电极界面都
	
	受到这一脉冲电场力的作用而相应地产生声脉冲.
	
	声脉冲的压力剖面与空间电荷的分布有关. 用声传
	
	感器接收与测量这些声脉冲, 就可以得到空间电荷
	
	的分布信息. 测量原理如图3, PEA 中样品内部的声
	
	波是由于外界窄脉冲的作用, 介质内部的空间电荷
	
	所受静电场力随时间变化, 为随时保持静电场力与
	
	介质弹性力的平衡, 介质就随外界电场振动起来, 这
	
	样就产生了声波.
	
	
	
	**比较**
	
	PWP 法的分辨率主要取决于压力脉冲波的脉冲半峰宽, 在压电
	
	PWP 法中, 较薄的压电膜可提高系统的分辨率; 而
	
	对于PEA 法, 越窄的电脉冲宽度和压电膜的厚度可
	
	以提高系统的分辨率.
	
	
	
	PEA 法的空间分辨率和灵敏度主要取决于电脉冲的
	
	形状和压电传感器的性能, 而PWP 法的分辨率主要
	
	取决于压力脉冲波的半峰宽, 灵敏度则主要取决于
