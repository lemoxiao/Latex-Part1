PolyU Thesis Template
=====================

This template is a simple modification of [the Clean **Thesis** package](http://cleanthesis.der-ric.de/).

Usage
-----

+ Edit the `thesis.tex` for making title page and organizing the thesis structure.
+ Add/Edit each chapter in the `content` folder
+ Replace/Add references to `bib-refs.bib`
+ Compile as usual

The Guide
---------

This package follows the **Guide** (`guide/thesis_format_guide.pdf`) of thesis formatting of Department of Computing of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 

According to my knowledge, the **Guide** is similar or maybe identical over the years. However this **Guide** is printed for each graduate only when he/she is going to take the viva. The name of the RC secretary of corresponding department was printed on the **Guide**. The attached **Guide** is a version free of the names and contacts of the RC secretary.

The Format Setting of this template
------------------

Simple fact: 
+ **The format of the thesis content is free.**
+  **Only several pages should be formatted according to the guide.**
+  **The sequence matters.**
