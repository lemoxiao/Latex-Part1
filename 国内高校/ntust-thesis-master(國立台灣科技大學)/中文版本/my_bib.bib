  abstract = {The establishment of shared cryptographic keys between communicating
	neighbor nodes in sensor networks is a challenging problem due to
	the unsuitability of asymmetric key cryptography for these resource-constrained
	platforms. A range of symmetric-key distribution protocols exist,
	but these protocols do not scale effectively to large sensor networks.
	For a given level of security, each protocol incurs a linearly increasing
	overhead in either communication cost per node or memory per node.
	We describe peer intermediaries for key establishment (PIKE), a class
	of key-establishment protocols that involves using one or more sensor
	nodes as a trusted intermediary to facilitate key establishment.
	We show that, unlike existing key-establishment protocols, both the
	communication and memory overheads of PIKE protocols scale sub-linearly
	(O({\&}radic;n)) with the number of nodes in the network yet achieving
	higher security against node compromise than other protocols. ER

	presents a set of fundamental protocols for building secure information
	distribution systems. Applications include wireless broadcast, IP
	multicast, sensor networks and webs, ad hoc networks, and satellite
	broadcast. This book presents and compares new techniques for basic
	operations including: <BR>*key distribution for access control, <BR>*source
	authentication of transmissions, and <BR>*non-repudiation of streams.
	</P> <P>This book discusses how to realize these operations both
	with high performance processors and resource constrained processors.
	It shows how to protect against adversaries who inject packets or
	eavesdrop. The focus is on functional descriptions rather than theoretical
	discussions. Protocols are presented as basic building blocks that
	can be combined with each other and traditional security protocols.
	The book illustrates these protocols in practice by presenting a
	real implementation that provides security for an ad hoc sensor network.
