This LaTeX template is a modified version. It is originally used by Yuan Ze University’s graduate students (Master and Ph.D). Following is the most important things being modified in the current version:

1. Provisional watermark
2. Cover format
3. Include the page containing Professor’s recommendation letter
4. Delete unnecessary pages
5. Update the file structure

While writing the thesis, please change every document whose name is my_xxxxxxx.xxx.

This TeX’s main file is my_ntust_thesis.tex.

Among everything that needs to be modified is in document named frontpages and backpages.

Please classify the thesis’ main structure and content into the related sections’ directory and table of contents.

Please put the references (BibTeX) onto the first layer of my_bib.bib

In order to generate the correct files, please ensure that it goes through four times compilation, otherwise the table of contents and the bibliography would be messed up.
