	To increase the imaging speed, we proposed a fast CW-THz imaging
	system in which a galvanometer is introduced. The galvanometer makes
	the beams reflected in different angles by vibrating at a certain
	frequency which can significantly decrease the image acquisition
	time compared to traditional CW-THz imaging system. Furthermore,
	the system is compact due to source and detector of small size. Examples
	of measurements of concealed weapons are presented and discussed.
	Ideal results of better resolution are obtained.},

  abstract = {The analogy between electromagnetic wave propagation in multidimensionally
	periodic structures and electron wave propagation in real crystals
	has proven to be a very fruitful one. Initial efforts were motivated
	by the prospect of a photonic band gap, a frequency band in three-dimensional
	dielectric structures in which electromagnetic waves are forbidden,
	irrespective of propagation direction in space. Today many new ideas
	and applications are being pursued in two and three dimensions, and
	in metallic, dielectric and acoustic structures, etc. The author
	reviews the early motivations for this work, which were derived from
	the need for a photonic band gap in quantum optics. This led to a
	series of experimental and theoretical searches for the elusive photonic
	band-gap structures, those three-dimensionally periodic dielectric
	structures which are to photon waves what semiconductor crystals
	are to electron waves. Then he describes how the photonic semiconductor
	can be 'doped', producing tiny electromagnetic cavities. Finally
	he summarizes some of the anticipated implications of photonic band
	structure for quantum electronics and the prospects for the creation
	of photonic crystals in the optical domain.},
