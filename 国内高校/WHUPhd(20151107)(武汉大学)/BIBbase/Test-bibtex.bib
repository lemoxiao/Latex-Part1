  abstract =     {The notion of a rough set introduced by Pawlak has often been compared to that of a fuzzy set,
sometimes with a view to prove that oneis more general, or, more useful than the other.Inthis paper
we arguethat both notions aim to different purposes. Seen this way, it is more natural to try to
combine the two models of uncertainty (vagueness and coarseness) rather than to have them compete
on the same problems. First, one may think of deriving the upper and lower approximations of afuzzy
set, when a reference scale is coarsened by means of an equivalence relation. We then come close to
Caianiello's C-calculus. Shafer's concept of coarsened belief functions also belongsto the same line of
thought. Another idea is to tum the equivalence relation into a fuzzy similarity relation, for the
modeling of coarseness, as already proposed by Fariiias del Cerro and Prade. Instead of using a
similarity relation, we can start withfuzzygranules which make afuzzypartition of the reference scale.
The maincontributionof the paper is to clarify the difference betweenfuzzysets and rough sets, and
unify several independent works which deal with similar ideas in different settings or notations.},
