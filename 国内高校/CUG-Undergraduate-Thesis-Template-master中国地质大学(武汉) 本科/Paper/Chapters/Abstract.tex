光切法显微镜是以光切法为测量原理， 测量表面粗糙度的专用光学仪器之一，它能在不破坏被测物质表面的条件下，测出截面轮廓的微观几何形状和沟槽宽度的实际尺寸.\par
荷叶因其表面的特殊结构而具有疏水性，具有自清洁效应，它所具有的这种特点被称作荷叶效应;而一般树叶、塑料、玻璃等物质表面却不具有疏水性.近二十年来有不少的研究人员对荷叶进行了研究，用高倍电子显微镜观测这些物质的表面，得到高了分辨率的表面结构像，对荷叶效应作了解释.像荷叶一样，芋头叶上的水珠也可以随意的滚动，也是荷叶效应的代表性植物，它的表面是否与荷叶表面相同？\par
本文的重点是通过使用光切法显微镜在不破坏叶片原表面结构的条件下观测芋头叶这种生活中常见的有超疏水表面植物的表面和一般灌木叶、竹叶等不具有超疏水表面或不完全疏水表面物质的表面，通过观测结果与已知的荷叶表面的观测结果作比对，从而在保持植物叶片表面结构完全原生的条件下对荷叶效应进行简单的探究.\\

Light-section microscope is one of the special optical instruments  for measuring the surface roughness.It has the advantage that it can be used to  measure  the cross-sectional profile of the micro geometry and the actual size of the slot width without any damage to  the surface of the test substance.\par
This characteristic that lotus has  hydrophobic surface caused by its special surface structure and self-cleaning effect is called lotus effect. While the general leaves, plastic, glass and other material's  surface is not hydrophobic. Numbers of researchers researched in lotus effect over the last two decades. They have explained the lotus effect with high resolution images of surface  structure taken by scanning electron microscope. Water can also rolling freely on taro leaves which is a typical plant that has louts effect like lotus. Whether it has the same  surface structure as the lotus leaf ?\par
The focus of this paper is to make a simple research about lotus effect by comparing the observations of taro and others without hydrophobic surface such as general shrub leaf and bamboo leaf under the condition of non-damage to substances with  known louts' surface structure .
