%% Before you embark on this quest you should probably read some of:
%% Deadly sins - http://ctan.mirror.garr.it/mirrors/CTAN/info/l2tabu/english/l2tabuen.pdf
%% Writing a thesis in LaTeX - http://tug.org/pracjourn/2008-1/mori/mori.pdf

\RequirePackage[l2tabu, orthodox]{nag} % tells you of any bad LaTeX usage
                                       % must be first thing in class (with the exception of comments)

%% There is one option you should define; oneside or twoside
%% Use twoside for your viva docs (examiners hate long docs they need to carry around)
%% and oneside for the final thing you submit to the library.  Note that margins will
%% change accordingly

\documentclass[twoside]{um}  % custom University of Malta project/dissertation/thesis
