%% Abstract.  Can span multiple paragraphs, just make sure they're
%% all inside the braces.
\abstract{The study of injective envelopes of metric spaces, also
  known as metric trees (R-trees or T-theory), has its motivation
  in many subdisciplines of mathematics as well as
  biology/medicine and computer science. Its relationship with
  biology and medicine stems from the construction of phylogenetic
  trees. Concepts from ``string matching" in computer science are
  closely related with the structure of metric trees. A metric
  tree is a metric space $(M,d)$ such that for every $x,y$ in $M$
  there is a unique arc between $x$ and $y$ and this arc is
  isometric to an interval in $\mathbb {R}$.

  In this talk, we examine convexity and compact structures in
  metric trees and apply these results to show the existence and
  uniqueness of best approximations. Several applications of best
  approximation in metric trees will also be discussed.}
