* If you find something odd, wrong or lacking, please email me; Mikael Ã–hman <mikael.ohman@chalmers.se>
  But *please* do NOT email me about standard latex questions, but only things specific to the chalmers-thesis document class.

* These files have been distributed through: http://www.github.com/Micket/chalmers

* No files with the Example prefix are necessary, but recommended to include as they serve as documentation.

* Sources for images comes from src_figures which aren't necessary for end users of the themes.

* If you are using the Chalmers linux system, you need to add texlive 2010 which is in unsup. In short, add this line
  . /chalmers/sw/unsup/texlive/bashrc.inc
  to
  ~/.bashrc
  or
  ~/.profile
  The file contains paths to the newer version of latex.

* subfiles is not in texlive yet. If you wish to use it, run latex on the *.ins file and copy everything to
  ~/texmf/tex/latex/subfiles/
  Subfiles package is available at
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfiles

* Template should work with either lualatex (possible xelatex) or pdflatex. With a recent version of lualatex installed,
  it should be preferred as it will give smaller files with nicer fonts (and more features).
