** Installation instruction *****************************************

      Sapthesis can be installed in 3 different ways:
	  
	  1. The simplest way to install sapthesis is by the package manager
      of your TeX distribution (TeX Live, MiKTeX or MacTeX).
      
      2. Instead, if you want to install sapthesis manually, you have to
      download the sapthesis.zip archive from CTAN or, better, from
      the official sapthesis website
      http://biccari.altervista.org/c/informatica/latex/sapthesis.php
      
      The sapthesis.zip archive contains: 

        1. sapthesis.cls (main file)
        2. sapthesis-doc.pdf (manual of sapthesis.cls)
        3. sapthesis-doc.tex (source of the manual)
        4. README (this file)
        5. sapienza-MLred-pos.pdf (red university logo)
        6. sapienza-MLblack-pos.pdf (black university logo)
		7. examples folder with several examples of usage
        8. sapthesis.bst (an english BibTeX style)
		9. sapthesis.layout (sapthesis layout file for LyX)

	  You can simply copy sapthesis.cls and sapthesis.bst
      together with sapienza-MLred-pos.pdf and
      sapienza-MLblack-pos.pdf into your local work directory where
      your thesis files will live.
	  
      3. The last possibility is copying the files of Sapthesis
	  (discussed in the previous point) into your texmf tree
      (or your localtexmf tree) at these locations:

      <texmf>/tex/latex/sapthesis/sapthesis.cls
      <texmf>/tex/latex/sapthesis/sapienza-MLred-pos.pdf
      <texmf>/tex/latex/sapthesis/sapienza-MLblack-pos.pdf
      <texmf>/doc/latex/sapthesis/sapthesis-doc.pdf
      <texmf>/doc/latex/sapthesis/sapthesis-doc.tex
      <texmf>/doc/latex/sapthesis/examples/....tex
      <texmf>/doc/latex/sapthesis/README
      <texmf>/bibtex/bst/sapthesis/sapthesis.bst
	  <texmf>/doc/latex/sapthesis/sapthesis.layout

      Then, you need to update the file database.
