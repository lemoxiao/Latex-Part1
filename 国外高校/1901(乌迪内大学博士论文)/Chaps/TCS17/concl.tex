\section{Conclusions}
In this chapter we have studied two well-behaved $\PSPACE$-complete fragments, $\AAbarBBbar$ and $\AAbarEEbar$, which
are quite promising from the point of view of applications.
MC for $\AAbarBBbarEbar$ and
$\AAbarEBbarEbar$ turns out to be in $\EXPSPACE$ and $\PSPACE$-hard.

Membership to $\PSPACE$ for the former two fragments and to $\EXPSPACE$ for the latter have been proved by means of
small-models which, in turn, rely on suitable (depending on the specific fragment) contraction techniques applied to the traces of a finite Kripke structure.
While the first result is novel, the second 
substantially simplifies the constructions and the complexity of the proofs
given for the same problem in~\cite{MMP15}.
