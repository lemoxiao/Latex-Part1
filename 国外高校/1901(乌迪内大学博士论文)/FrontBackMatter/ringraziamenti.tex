This thesis is the result of a three-year period of research on automatic system verification, which actually started with my master thesis (and even before graduating!).
This ``journey'' called PhD
has given me the opportunity of enriching myself (from the cultural point of view, clearly!), of knowing outstanding people from this research area, and traveling to places (most of them beautiful!) where, probably, I would have never gone in other situations.

I would like to thank for this experience some people that I affectionately want to call my ``travel mates'':
in primis, Angelo Montanari and Adriano Peron---also for helping me during my (seemingly periodic) ``reflection periods''---then Pietro Sala,
Laura Bozzelli and Gabriele Puppis.
I also express gratitude to the external referees, Alessio Lomuscio and 
St√©phane Demri, for the reviews of my 
thesis.

I thank my parents, my grandma, my aunt and uncle for\dots{} everything!
I bet my words would not be enough to express what I feel like saying,
but I am sure they know how grateful I am to them. %without the need to tell them explicitly.
And, I was forgetting\dots{} thank you also to my brother for taking me to the station so many times :)
