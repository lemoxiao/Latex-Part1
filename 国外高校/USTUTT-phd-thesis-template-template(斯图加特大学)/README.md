Using with your git repository
==============================

Initialization
--------------
This howto assumes that you have not a git repository for your thesis.
If you have, just add https://github.com/latextemplates/USTUTT-phd-thesis-template.git as upstream and merge the branch "template" into your "master" branch.

1. Open command line
1. git clone https://github.com/latextemplates/USTUTT-phd-thesis-template.git
1. cd USTUTT-phd-thesis-template
1. git remote rename origin github
1. git checkout -b master

Now, you are on the master branch, where you can write your thesis and push it to your (remote) origin repository, in case you have one.

Merging updates from the template
---------------------------------
If you want to merge updates from github, do the following:

1. git fetch github
1. git merge github/template
