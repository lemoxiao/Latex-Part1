# thesis-template

The repo contains a LaTeX template for degree-specific thesis at University Duisburg-Essen.

The LaTeX distribution used in this template is Tex Live (available at: https://tug.org/texlive/). There are also various different LaTeX distributions available, you can also choose whichever you prefer, however the compatibility with this template is not yet fully ensured.

The editor used is TeXstudio (available at: https://www.texstudio.org/).

:heavy_exclamation_mark: If you decided to use this template with TeXstudio as editor, you should firstly set the "Default compiler" as XeLaTeX and the "Default Bibliography Tool" as biber.

It is recommended to use some literature mangement software during your thesis, as a student of University Duisburg-Essen, you have access to EndNote and Citavi with the university subscription (check https://www.uni-due.de/ub/abisz/literaturverwaltung.shtml).

In case of any desired fuctions or tutorials, as well as the errors contained in this template, feel free to comment in the "Issues" of this repo. I will check and update this template when it is necessary.

Thanks and wish you all have a successful thesis writing!
