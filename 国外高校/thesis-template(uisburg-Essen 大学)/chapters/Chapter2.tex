\chapter{Text Structure}

% set folder path of figures, so that only figure names are needed when insert figures
\graphicspath{ {graphics/Chapter3/} }

In a chapter it usually has several levels of sections and subsections to keep the contents well organized. 

\section{This is a new section}

	\subsection{This is a new subsection}
	
		Although in \LaTeX, there is also a {\color{blue}{\verb|\subsubsection|}} command which can generate an extra level of contents under subsection, it is not recommended to be used. The possible solution maybe:
		
		\paragraph{\colorbox{yellow!50}{A new paragraph}}
		
		instead of 
		
		\subsubsection{\colorbox{yellow!50}{A new subsubsection}}
		
		It should be noticed that all font types and spacing before or after the titles can be customized in the \href{thesis-template.cls}{cls-file}.
		
	\subsection{Make a list}
		
		It is also quite often to list out some important points in the text.
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This is an unimportant entry
			\item This is another unimportant entry :D
		\end{itemize}
