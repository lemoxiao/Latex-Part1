% Scott - For Windows and LEd compatibitility, PSTricks was separated from the node and tree packages, and [pdf] was added (so pdflatex command can compile). Also, auto-pst-pdf allows postscript-to-pdf conversion of the tree- creating macros mentioned below. See this thread for more info: http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/8413/how-to-use-pstricks-in-pdflatex
\usepackage[pdf]{pstricks}
\usepackage[off]{auto-pst-pdf}
\usepackage{pst-node,pst-tree} 

% This allows for tree- creating macros
% from the pstricks graphics package.

\usepackage{pst-plot} 
% This allows for data plotting macros from the pstricks
% package.


\usepackage{amsmath} % This allows more mathematical formatting macros.
\usepackage{amsfonts} % This allows more mathematical fonts.

\usepackage{verbatim} 
% This allows files contents to be printed in the latex

% A new command to be used in the bibliography environment. It will label each

\newcounter{bibitemcounter} % The counter to be used to label bibitems.
\newcommand*{\bibliographyitem}[1]{\addtocounter{bibitemcounter}{1}
\bibitem[\thebibitemcounter]{#1}}

% This command comes from pg. 49 of Latex Graphics Companion. For making spanning
% braces to be placed in unusual ways.
% #1, #2 allow for moving the middle of the brace horizontally or vertically by a number of points.
% #3 is rotation angle for large brace in degrees.
% #4 is total height of the brace in points.
