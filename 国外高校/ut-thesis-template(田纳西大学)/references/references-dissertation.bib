  abstract = {The Taylor–Culick solution for a porous cylinder is often used to
	describe the bulk gas motion in idealized representations of solid
	rocket motors. However, other approximate solutions may be found
	that satisfy the same fundamental constraints. In this vein, steeper
	or smoother profiles may be observed in either experimental or numerical
	tests, particularly in the presence of intense levels of acoustic
	energy. In this study, we use the Lagrangian optimization principle
	to arrive at multiple solutions that can help to explain the practically
	observed motions. We then search for the extreme states that display
	either the least or the most kinetic energy. These are derived and
	found to be dependent on the chamber’s aspect ratio. By assuming
	a slender case, simple expressions are retrieved from which both
	the rotational Taylor–Culick and the irrotational Hart–McClure solutions
	are recovered as special cases. At the outset, a new family of flow
	approximations is derived extending from purely potential to highly
	rotational fields. These are constructed, verified and catalogued
	based on their kinetic energies. To help understand the tendency
	of a motion to shift energy states, a second law analysis is performed
	and used to rank these solutions based on their entropy content.
	Interestingly, the Taylor–Culick profile is found to represent an
	equilibrium state entailing the most energy and entropy among those
	starting from the rest. A formal extension of Kelvin’s minimum energy
	theorem to an open region is then pursued, followed by a direct implementation
	to the problem at hand. Three other flow motions with open boundaries
	are examined to further exemplify the application of Kelvin’s extended
	criteria. Our efforts illustrate the overarching harmony that exists
	between Lagrange’s minimization principle and Kelvin’s minimum energy
	theorem; both converge on the potential solution as the least kinetic
	energy bearer even when the velocity at the open barrier is finite.},
