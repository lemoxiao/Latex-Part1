This is a \LaTeX{} template and document class for Ph.D. dissertations at Princeton University. It was created in 2010 by Jeffrey Dwoskin, and adapted from a template provided by the math department. Their original version is available at: \url{http://www.math.princeton.edu/graduate/tex/puthesis.html}

This is \textbf{NOT} an official document. Please verify the current Mudd Library dissertation requirements~\cite{mudd2009} and any department-specific requirements before using this template or document class.


Your abstract can be any length, but should be a maximum of 350 words for a Dissertation for ProQuest's print indicies (or 150 words for a Master's Thesis); otherwise it will be truncated for those uses~\cite{proquest2006}.
