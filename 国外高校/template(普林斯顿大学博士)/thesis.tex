%%% For print copies
%% set 'singlespace' option to set entire thesis to single space, and define "\printmode" to remove all hyperlinks for printed copies of the thesis. Delete all output files before changing this mode -- it will turn hyperref package on and off
%\documentclass[12pt,lot, lof, singlespace]{puthesis}
%\newcommand{\printmode}{}

%%% For the electronic copy, use doublespacing, define "\proquestmode" to use outlined links, instead of colored links. 
\documentclass[12pt,lot, lof]{puthesis}
\newcommand{\proquestmode}{}
% I prefer proquestmode to be off for electronic copies for normal use, since the colored links are less distracting. However when printed in black and white, the colored links are difficult to read. 

%%% For early drafts without some of the frontmatter
% Also see the "ifodd" command below to disable more frontmatter

%%%% Tweak float placements
% From: http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/bibliog/latex/floats.html "Controlling LaTeX Floats"
% and based on: http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=floats
% LaTeX defaults listed at: http://people.cs.uu.nl/piet/floats/node1.html

% Alter some LaTeX defaults for better treatment of figures:
    % See p.105 of "TeX Unbound" for suggested values.
    % See pp. 199-200 of Lamport's "LaTeX" book for details.
    %   General parameters, for ALL pages:
    \renewcommand{\topfraction}{0.85}	% max fraction of floats at top
    \renewcommand{\bottomfraction}{0.6}	% max fraction of floats at bottom
    %   Parameters for TEXT pages (not float pages):
    \setcounter{topnumber}{2}
    \setcounter{bottomnumber}{2}
    \setcounter{totalnumber}{4}     % 2 may work better
    \setcounter{dbltopnumber}{2}    % for 2-column pages
    \renewcommand{\dbltopfraction}{0.66}	% fit big float above 2-col. text
    \renewcommand{\textfraction}{0.15}	% allow minimal text w. figs
    %   Parameters for FLOAT pages (not text pages):
    \renewcommand{\floatpagefraction}{0.66}	% require fuller float pages
	% N.B.: floatpagefraction MUST be less than topfraction !!
    \renewcommand{\dblfloatpagefraction}{0.66}	% require fuller float pages

% The documentclass already sets parameters to make a high penalty for widows and orphans.
