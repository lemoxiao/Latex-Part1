
\chapter{Related Work\label{ch:pastwork}}

Everyone needs a chapter about related work, so here is a placeholder.

% include other files for sections of this chapter. These use the 'input' command since each section within a chapter should not start a new page.
% If you want to swap the order of sections, it is as simple as reversing the order you include them.
