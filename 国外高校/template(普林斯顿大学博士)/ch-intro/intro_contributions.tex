This document serves as a template to demonstrate how to use the \texttt{puthesis} documentclass for a Princeton University Ph.D.\ Disseration. Some of the requirements for a master's thesis or an undergraduate thesis are different, especially the text on the title page, so you will need to make some modifications to use this template for those purposes. 

This template is setup to easily make a few different versions of your dissertation. The version you will print and have bound should generally be single spaced (and single-sided), and not contain any hyperlinks. The electronic version that you submit to your readers to review and to be published by ProQuest will be double spaced, and will contain PDF features such as bookmarks for each section and internal links to citations, footnotes, and other internal references.  

During the writing process, you may want to disable some of the frontmatter (list of tables, list of figures, acknowledgements, and maybe even the table of contents. I have not tested this template with equations or a list of symbols, but those are available.
