I would like to thank the Math department for providing the original documentclass file that this class is based upon. I would like to thank my parents, without whom my life would not be possible. I would also like to thank my advisor, my dissertation committee, and my research collaborators because every graduate student needs to do so. And finally, I thank the members of my research group, to whom I leave this template to save you some of the trouble I had to go through getting my dissertation to compile in \LaTeX{}.  

Don't forget to ask your advisor if your work was sponsored by a grant that needs to be acknowledged in this section.
