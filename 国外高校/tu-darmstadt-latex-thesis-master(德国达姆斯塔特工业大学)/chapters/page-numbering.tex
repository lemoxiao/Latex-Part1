The template consists of four parts. 

The first part includes the title and second page and doesn't have any page numbers. 

The second part consists of the table of contents, list of figures, list of tables, acronyms and symbols. It has roman page numbers and starts at \textbf{I}. 

The third part contains the main content. It has arabic page numbers and starts at \textbf{1}. 

The fourth and last part includes the bibliography. It has roman page numbers and continues the counting from part two.

The title and second page don't have any page numbers. It is therefore important to start with the roman page numbering below the command \textbf{\textbackslash makethesistitle}. Otherwise \LaTeX{} will throw warnings like

\begin{verbatim}
pdfTeX warning (ext4): 
destination with the same identifier (name{page.}) has been already used,
duplicate ignored
\end{verbatim}
