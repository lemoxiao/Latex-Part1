This is version 0.2 of DIthesis, a Latex2e document class for undergraduate 
theses at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications, University 
of Athens.

This work consists of the following files:
+===================+================================+
| athena.jpg        | University logo                |
| dithesis.cls      | Class source                   |
| README            |                                |
| sample.pdf        | Documentation in Arial PDF     |
| sample.tex        | Documentation in Arial source  |
| sampleNoArial.pdf | Documentation in CMU Serif PDF |
| sampleNoArial.tex | Documentation in CMU source    |
+===================+================================+

The documentation files also serve as sample theses.
Both documentation files were compiled with XeLaTeX:
 *  sample.tex on a Microsoft Windows platform under MikTex.
 *  sampleNoArial.tex on a Linux platform, 

The class (dithesis.cls) successfully compiles with pdflatex, too, but I did 
not figure out how to set up Greek there.
