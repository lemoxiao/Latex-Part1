                  +--------------------------------+                  |EQPARBOX: Equal-widthed parboxes|                  |By Scott Pakin <pakin@uiuc.edu> |                  +--------------------------------+Description-----------LaTeX users sometimes need to ensure that two or more blocks of textoccupy the same amount of horizontal space on the page.  To that end,the eqparbox package defines a new command, \eqparbox, which worksjust like \parbox, except that instead of specifying a width, onespecifies a tag.  All eqparboxes with the same tag -- regardless ofwhere they are in the document -- will stretch to fit the widesteqparbox with that tag.  This simple, equal-width mechanism can beused for a variety of alignment purposes, as is evidenced by theexamples in eqparbox's documentation.Installation------------There's nothing special about building eqparbox:    latex eqparbox.ins     <== Generate eqparbox.sty    latex eqparbox.dtx     <== Produce the documentation (eqparbox.dvi)    latex eqparbox.dtx     <== Again, to get labels and eqparboxes right    makeindex -s gind.ist eqparbox    <== Generate an index    latex eqparbox.dtx     <== Incorporate the index into the documentIf you're new to this, seehttp://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=instpackages for moreinformation on installing packages.Copyright and license---------------------Copyright (C) 2001 Scott Pakin <pakin@uiuc.edu>This package may be distributed and/or modified under the conditionsof the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.2 of thislicense or (at your option) any later version.
