# A Coventry University Thesis LaTeX Template

I needed a LaTeX template to use in [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/ "ShareLaTeX") when writing up my thesis. Since I couldn't find one for Coventry University I adapted an existing template. Being based in the Faculty of Engineering, Environment and Computing (EEC) I used the [Cambridge University Engineering Department (CUED) template](https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template "Cambridge Template on GitHub") as the starting point, though social science schools and faculties should find it applicable.

Ideas, suggestions and changes welcome.

## Coventry University Engineering PhD Thesis Template

* A LaTeX / XeLaTeX / LuaLaTeX thesis template for a Coventry University PhD.
* Version 2017-08-16.
* [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT "View MIT License Online").

## Author(s)
* Based on the [Cambridge University Engineering Department PhD. Template](https://github.com/kks32/phd-thesis-template "Cambridge Template on GitHub") by Krishna Kumar.
* Adapted for Coventry University by [Daniel S. Fowler](http://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/areas-of-research/mobility-transport/cyber-security/ "Dan").

## Differences from the CUED template.

* Removed the Cambridge University crest, references and colleges options.
* Added a Coventry University front page logo.
* Replaced the copyrighted example images with public domain clip art from [openclipart.org](https://openclipart.org "openclipart.org")
* Removed build files not required by ShareLaTeX (can be obtained from the CUED template).
* Added more tutorial text as an introduction to the template, how to use it and pointers to further help, especially for those new to LaTeX.
