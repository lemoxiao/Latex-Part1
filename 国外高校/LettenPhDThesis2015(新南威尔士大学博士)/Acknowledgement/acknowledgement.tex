For what has been an incredibly rewarding and wonderfully challenging 45 months I have several people to thank, several times over. David, for being a superb supervisor, whose unstinting zen and benevolent wisdom are a template for academic mentorship. Richard and Will, who both played the role of unofficial supervisors and always left their doors ajar. Sharon, whose gravitational pull kept me (and everyone else) in orbit. Dan, Mick and John for providing valuable advice along the way. Steve and Bill who as panel members took a much appreciated interest in my progression. Cam who provided valuable insights into my original project proposal. Various other fantastic UNSW folk that have contributed to the fun, including in no particular order: Sam, Sylvia, Eve, Mitch, Nick, Evan, Jo, Chris, Ben, Anna, Chantel, Francis, David and the Ecostats crew, Angela, Haba, Rhiannnon and the rest of the Big Ecology lab. The brilliant academics of the UCT Botany Dept, and in particular Jeremy and Tony who as honours supervisors made me think differently, in a really good way. My patient parents who have supported me unconditionally in my every pursuit. My generous brother who amongst many other things has done his best to keep me in fashion. My wonderful wife Shan, a mention in the acknowledgements of my thesis almost makes a mockery of your contribution; you rock like Kilimanjaro. Finally, I thank my amazing little Ash Mae, who makes me stop and smell the roses (and the nappies).
