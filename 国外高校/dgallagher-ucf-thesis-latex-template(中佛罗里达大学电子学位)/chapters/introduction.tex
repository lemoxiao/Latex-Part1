\section{Template information}
This template was originally developed in 2007 in compliance with the UCF ETD masters thesis guidelines \cite{ETD_Format}. It has since been used by various colleges in their PhD dissertation submissions. At this time there was no official LaTeX template available from the university. There is now a basic template supplied by the editor in Graduate studies located on the  \cite{ETD_Format}. However, some may prefer to use this template for there needs.

\subsection{Motivation}
By publishing my template in a public git repository \cite{TemplateGit}, I hope that the template may be used by others and will continue to evolve with the revised ETD format guidelines through user contributed updates.
