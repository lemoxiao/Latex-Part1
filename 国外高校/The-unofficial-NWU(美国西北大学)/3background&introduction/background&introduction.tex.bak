Understanding the atmosphere has been an endeavor of man since the ancient
Greeks. In 340\gls{B.C}, Aristotle wrote the first know meteorological
text, \textit{Meteorological}, speculating on the processes of various
meteorological phenomenons \citep{frisinger1972aristotle}. This was to be
the start of future endeavors that would shape our understanding of the
earth's climate and weather systems. Centuries later the concept of
anthropogenic climate change was formed by \cite{arrhenius1896xxxi} as he
speculated that an increase in carbon dioxide may lead to an increase in
the average temperature. He later stated, that \textit{"the advances of
industry might noticeably increase the atmospheric concentration of
carbon dioxide in the course of a few centuries"}
\citep{arrhenius1908worlds}. Years later \cite{arrhenius1908worlds,
arrhenius1896xxxi} theories would be proven correctly, the
\cite{intergovernmental2007fourth, intergovernmental2014climate} found
greenhouse emissions as the main cause of the increase in global
temperature and severe weather events \citep{botzen2010climate,
kapsch2012long}. These severe events, and more specifically severe
hailstorms, form the basis of the study.  Hailstorms, which are by nature
rare, seem to have increased in frequency \citep{wuebbles2014severe,
hermida2015hailfall, changnon2009increasing, li2016hail}. The implications
of such an increase could be dire for humans in regions prone to such
events. Severe hail events have a devastating socio-economic impact on a
region, numerous hail storms have resulted in unprecedented loss throughout
history; from the origins French revolution to the complete destruction of
agricultural regions, damage to property and automobiles and in the most
extreme of cases the loss of human lives. South-Africa has not been spared
from these severe hail events.  Recent storms over the Gauteng province,
the economic hub of Africa, has been among the most costly of natural
disasters the country experienced until now.  Extreme hail is a phenomena
that can cause havoc and yet we understand little about this spatially and
temporally rare event and how they are linked from the small scale
convective environment to larger scale synoptic circulation. 

The recent severe hailstorms over South-Africa has renewed interest in hail
studies to build upon past research. During the 1960's - 1980's three major
hail research programs existed in South-Africa. These programs were funded
by both state and/or private organizations at the time
\citep{kelbe1984cumulus, olivier1989some}. The first program, funded by the
\gls{CSIR}, was a network of hail-pads set-up in Gauteng, the then
Transvaal region, with around 800 volunteers in a 2800 $km^{2}$ area
\citep{carte1967areal, held1974hail}. The presence of the hail-pad network
assisted in various hail related research publications during this era
\citep{schulze1965hail, carte1967areal, held1974hail, carte1978variability,
held1979hailstorms, carte1979sustained}.  Other programs included a weather
modification program established by the \gls{SAWS}, Sentraoes Insurance
Co.\ and the \gls{WRC} in die 1970's. The program, known as \gls{BEWMEX},
originally studied hail suppression but subsequently shifted its focus to
rainfall research \citep{erasmus1980formulation}. Finally, the Program for
the Augmentation of Atmospheric Water Supply \citep{mather1977analysis} in
Nelspruit, Mpumalanga, was a privately funded hail suppression program
established in the 1970's, but it also switched objectives towards rainfall
studies later on.  \cite{mather1977analysis} research was such a
breakthrough the time that a subsequent review published later by
\cite{summers1978comments} noted that the work was an important step in
hail suppression research as it was the first to directly seed the super
cooled portion of clouds. \cite{mather1977analysis} also introduced the
concept of \textit{a severity ratio} in his work; this is defined as the
area damaged to 100\% divided by the area hit by hail
\citep{summers1978comments}. The last major investigation of hail was by
\cite{olivier1990thesis} in her PhD thesis where she examined the spatial,
temporal and atmospheric characteristics of hail days over the Highveld
while also investigating the impact on maize production across the
Highveld. Later research by \cite{olivier1995links} investigated the links
between \gls{SOI} and hail events, in their paper a correlation between the
occurrence of hail and the \gls{SOI} was observed, noting that a increase
in \gls{HDF} was accompanied with a low \gls{SOI}. Despite this history
of hail research in South-Africa, in time focus has shifted towards
rainfall due to the dependence on this resource in a water scares country
like South-Africa. 


\subsection{A brief outline of the study}

The study aims to build on existing research by characterizing hailstorms
across different atmospheric scales over the Highveld with the aim to
answer the main research question; \textbf{What is the trend and cycles of
hailstorms over the Highveld?} 

The dissertation is divided into 6 major chapters, each addressing the main
question related to this study in different ways.  First the background and
introduction examines some of the impacts of severe weather events and also
severe hailstorms with the aim of providing the reader an overview of the
devastation that these events can have on our daily lives.  The chapter
moves on to briefly discuss the climatology of South-Africa, which systems
impact our daily weather followed by a brief hail climatology of
South-Africa and Gauteng. The sections continues by providing a background
of literature relating to \textit{the problem of scale}. First a review of
\gls{NWP} is provided as related to micro and meso scale events in the
atmosphere. This is followed by an overview of macroscale classification
techniques used to understand the larger scale synoptic circulation.
Chapter 2 - 5 deals with the data related to this study and the results
obtained trough the numerical simulations, cluster analysis and trends
analysis as described later on. The last chapter attempts to understand the
how the links identified have changed in time and if there is a increased
change of environments favored for hail producing storms. Additional
datasets are used in this chapter. Radiosonde data from the \gls{IGRA} and
historical media reports related to hail events is examined and a trend
analysis is conducted over a period of $\ge 40$ years. 

\section{The impacts of severe weather events}

Anthropogenic climate change has become a mainstream topic worldwide. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has stated in its reports
this is mainly due to human activities related to the burning of fossil
fuels around the world \citep{intergovernmental2007fourth,
intergovernmental2014climate, kruger2013trends}. There is already a large
body of research examining the effects of anthropogenic climate change
around the world and in South-Africa. \citep{schiesser1990hailfall}.
\cite{changnon2009increasing} notes there is an increase in severe
hailstorms over the \gls{USA} since the 1950's while
\cite{rosenzweig2002increased} estimated that the annual loss due to severe
weather is likely to increase by \gls{USD}3 billion per year. In China,
\cite{li2016hail} found that hail days are likely to increase by 5\% from
2030 onwards in some regions while \cite{brooks2013severe} predicts that
environments suitable for severe storms will increase in the future.
Predictions for South-Africa estimate an increase in extreme heat days
\citep{kruger2013trends}, a decrease in extreme cold days
\citep{new2006evidence} and an increase in extreme precipitation events and
convective events \citep{roy2013spatial}. These predictions could be far
reaching, impacting insurance, agriculture, health and water availability,
especially the part of the population who are most vulnerable; the poor.
According to the report by the World Health Organization (WHO)
\citep{hales2003impacts} deaths related to extreme events in the 1980's and
1990's numbered around 1.2 million. There is also a relationship between
meteorological events and diseases, \cite{hales2003impacts} mentions the
connection between rainfall and the presence of mosquitoes for instance.
After heavy events an abundance of surface water could lead to an increase
in infectious diseases such as malaria, yellow fever and dengue (all
carried by mosquitoes). Other vectors such as rodents and ticks also thrive
in certain climatological conditions, carrying more infections diseases
\citep{hales2003impacts}. 

The most vulnerable of the population -- those who live in rural areas and
low income settlements, suffer economic hardship, lack government support
and quality infrastructure -- are the people who will be most affected by
this possible increase in severe events. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change describes vulnerability as: 
	
\begin{quotation}\textit{"\ldots the degree to which geophysical,
biological and socio-economic systems are susceptible to, and unable to
cope with, adverse impacts of climate change"}
\cite{intergovernmental2007fourth}.\end{quotation}

According to \cite{okuyama2009impact} damages, from 1960 to 2007, as a
result of natural disasters amount to USD742 billion while meteorological
and climatological events make up 36\% (USD271 billion) of this damages.
The importance of understanding such events is clearly crucial to minimize
the possible damages and losses that can occur, this is however difficult
for some countries faced with other economic and social issues 
\citep{doswell2003societal}. Damage related to extreme events that
occurs in countries with diverse, high to middle-income economies tend to
have a major higher order economic impact compared to countries with a
simple economic structure, however, these \textit{poor} countries tend to
struggle with the aftermath of extreme damage while economically stronger
countries can endure and successfully recover from such events
\citep{okuyama2008critical, noy2009macroeconomic}.

\cite{jahn2015economics} classifies the economic impact due to severe
weather into, direct or indirect, non-market, time-horizon and positive
impacts and  finally direct losses by sector and time.  \textit{Direct
losses} refers to direct impact an event has, e.g. the physical destruction
of property, whilst \textit{indirect losses} refers the losses of a third
party affected by the direct losses.  \textit{Non-market effect} refers to
any commodities damaged in the event of a storm, but the monetary value of
such as losses is hard to asses.  \cite{jahn2015economics} uses the example
of a attraction being damaged (e.g. religious statue), although the
monetary value can be quantified the symbolic value of the original work
not assessable. \textit{Time horizon and positive impacts} focuses on the
spatio-temporal impacts. With the advent of an extreme event damage cost
starts to accumulate, when the event ceases it can either yield economic
gains or losses for two reasons, (1) stimulus effect, additional demand for
a resource and (2) productivity effect, damaged goods are replaced by new
goods \citep{jahn2015economics}. \cite{noy2010economics} found that
natural disasters has a short term positive growth effect in developed
regions but not in remote regions, \cite{jahn2015economics} emphasises that
when there is no economic stimulus following a disaster, a region can fall
into a poverty trap or cycle of long-term negative growth. Finally,
\textit{direct losses by sector and time} examines the influence of an
event on specific sectors contributing to the economy; these can be short
term and or long term effects on critical sectors, while some events may
have a positive effect for some sectors other events may lead to a loss in
another sector, if a country can identify the possible impacts on various
sectors and plan mitigation methods for when such events may occur,
economically and social resilience can be improved.
\citep{jahn2015economics}.  
		 
\subsection{Economics of severe hailstorms around the World}
\label{sec:damageworld}

The economic loss due to hailstorms can be extensive, especially when these
storms occur over densely populated urban areas. Hail damage in the past has
dominated the percentage of total insurance pay-outs within a specific area and
year such as Munich, Germany 1984 (55\%), Denver, \gls{USA} 1990 (50\%) and Sydney,
Australia 1990 (43\%) \citep{hohl2002use}. Severe hail
storms have set some records related to insurance payouts; a severe hailstorm in Sydney,
Australia caused damages of over 1.6 billion\gls{AUSD} in damages, exceeding the cost of
any previous natural catastrophe in the country \citep{gero2006impact}. During
2006 a hailstorm in the United States' Mid-West region broke the record for the
most costly hailstorm; causing over \gls{USD}1.8 billion in damages to property;
the specific event was also the most expensive catastrophe for the U.S in 2006
\citep{changnon2009increasing}. A 2001 hailstorm in the same region lasted 8
hours, covered over 550km and caused over \gls{USD}1.5 billion in damages in the
states of Illinois and Missouri \citep{changnon2006severe}.
Two separate hailstorms, on two different continents, resulted in the most costly
day for insurers in 2013 -- in Europe a hailstorm amounted damages of EUR2.8
billion \citep{punge2016hail} and in South-Africa damages amounted to
over 1.6 billion \gls{ZAR} in the country's most costly insurance payout to date. 
			
Agriculture is another major sector impacted by hail events, but according to 
\cite{punge2016hail} measuring the agricultural impact of hail is a
difficult task as data over agricultural land is mostly recorded during growing
season, events outside this frame mostly go unrecorded. In Europe, the most
losses due to hailstorms on agricultural production occurs in Spain, followed by
France and Italy \citep{sanchez2003analysis}. Insurance companies pay an
estimated EUR100 million to crop losses in Spain's hail prone areas annually. In
the Lleida valley located in Spain farmers pay an average of EUR15 million
towards hail damage insurance \citep{aran2011atmospheric, sanchez2003analysis}.
In Cyprus a total of EUR22.7 million was paid out by insurance companies to
cover the damage on agricultural sectors from 1996-2006, 28.4\% of the
total compensation paid in this period nationwide
\citep{nicolaides2009impact}.  \cite{changnon1972examples} estimated the
total crop loss due to hail in the \gls{USA} at \gls{USD}284 million (an
estimated \gls{USD}1.6 billion in 2016) and about 1\% of total crop
production. Argentina's Mendoza province records 10\% losses to agriculture
from hailstorms \citep{rosenfeld2006aircraft}.

\paragraph{Economics of severe hailstorms in South-Africa}
\label{sec:damagesouthafrica}

The history of hailstorms over South-Africa has been well documented in
\cite{bureau1991history}; the first recorded hailstorm in South-Africa was in
1692 off the Cape Town coast. Since then South-Africans have documented frequent
severe hail events across the country. Hailstorms over the Gauteng Province have
been documented as early as 1928 when a storm over Johannesburg caused \gls{ZAR}1
million in damages -- a substantial amount at the time. In 1936 \textit{hailstones
the size of coconuts} killed 10 people and an unknown amount of livestock in
Northern Gauteng \citep{grobler2003framework, perry1995severe}. On 17 November
1949 a storm so severe occurred over Pretoria it apparently damaged every
building within the city, and resulted in the National Building Research
Institute Council For Scientific and Industrial Research publishing a report on the hail resistance of
South-Africa roofing material \citep{rigby1952hail, bureau1991history}. Another
hailstorm in the region on 1 November 1985 was ranked as one of the worlds top
10 most destructive hailstorms at the time, while a storm in 1992 resulted in
the death of 14 people in East-Griekwaland \citep{perry1995severe}. 
	
The most expensive pay day for insurances in South-Africa occurred on 28
November 2013 when a massive hailstorm over the Gauteng area caused over
\gls{ZAR}1,6 billion in damages. More than a hundred houses were damaged in the
suburbs Dobsonville, Bramfischerville, Emdeni and Soweto; trees in the suburbs of
Florida and Roodepoort and Vereeniging were destroyed by the storm
\citep{iol2013hail}. Power-lines across the province were damaged resulting in
electricity problems \citep{ewn2013hail}. Earlier the month, on the 11th and the
18th of November, several other severe storms occurred over the region resulting in damage to
property. The combination of these events and the damage caused led to renowned 
interest in hail research, especially over the Highveld where these storms caused
the most damage. In 2014 there was session on hail in South-Africa hosted by the
Insurance Institute of South-Africa, shedding light on the \gls{ZAR}1.6 billion
in losses experienced by the public and insurers during these hail events. 

South-Africa's agricultural regions aren't spared from these severe events.
Early research by \cite{theron1973economic} on the agricultural impact of
hailstorms in South-Africa estimated the hail events in this sector to
amount to a 2,1\% loss in agriculture production.  \cite{olivier1992impact}
estimated the annual loss could be as high 9\% of the total production.
\cite{bureau1991history} has various details about storms impacting
agriculture. In 1914 over 500 sheep where killed in a storm over Harding in
KwaZulu-Natal, while a storm in 1946 killed 42 sheep and crops over a large
part of the Free-State. On new years eve of 1959 one of the most
devastating storms hit the farming sector, in addition to crops being
destroyed, several thousand animals including sheep, poultry and game were
killed. On 29 December 1997 a severe hail storm over the Free-State caused
\gls{ZAR}15 million in damages to crops in the Reitz area
\citep{de2000severe}. The impact of hail may not always be direct, after
1986 a hail event in the Cape province a pine plantation became infected
with \textit{Sphaeropsis sapinea}, a blight disease, and resulted in an
estimated loss of 55\% of total potential production or an estimated
\gls{ZAR}2.5 million \citep{zwolinski1990economic}

\section{Scales in the atmosphere}
\label{atmospherescale}

Difficulties arise when trying to study severe events.
\cite{wuebbles2014severe, hermida2015hailfall} notes there is a limited
understanding of extreme events like hail, ice storms, tornadoes and strong
winds -- events rare in their spatial and temporal extend
\citep{carte1978variability}. This poses problems when trying to analyze
the events on any scale, however, because extreme damage can often occur in
a short period of time often without any warning a better understanding of
these events is a necessity.

Defining the spatio-temporal variation (scale) of different atmospheric
phenomenons was first addressed by \citep{orlanski1975rational}. He defined
the atmosphere into three major divisions, microscale (20m $\lessgtr$ 20m) <
mesoscale (2km $\lessgtr$ 2000km) < macroscale (2000km +), subdivided in $\gamma,
\beta$ and $\alpha$ scales respectively. Because the atmosphere is dynamic
each scale also has a temporal element linked to it, microscale phenomenons
are typically in the order of $\leq$ 1 hour, mesoscale phenomenons 1 hour
$\lessgtr$ 1 week and finally macroscale phenomenons $\geq$ 1 week.
According to \cite{dyson2013atmospheric}, mesoscale systems may produce
extreme rainfall over South-Africa, thunderstorms associated with these
mesoscale systems occur within the meso-$\gamma$ and upper micro-$\alpha$
range, an important phenomena associated with hail events as discussed
later in the chapter. Mesoscale systems are linked to larger scale
circulation patterns defined as meso-$\alpha$, macro-$\beta$ and
macro-$\alpha$, better known as synoptic circulation
\cite{pielke1992comprehensive}. Similar scales exists in atmospheric
modeling, discussed in \hyperref[subsec:modelscales]{page
\pageref{subsec:modelscales}}. 

\begin{table}[H]

\end{tabular}%
}
\end{table}

Each scale (macro, meso and micro) has characteristic features that
influence surface weather. To understand the links between the
meso-$\gamma$ scale features and surface weather meteorologists around the
world launch weather balloons, also know as radiosondes, into the
atmosphere on a daily basis to gather atmospheric data. The upper-air
soundings allow meteorologist to form an idea of the current state of the
atmosphere in a limited spacial and temporal area, not only can products
such as tephigram, skew-t and hodographs be created from these soundings,
describing the vertical state of the atmosphere, it also forms a crucial
part in the collection of data used to initiate \gls{NWP} models.
Unfortunately upper-air soundings only give scientists an idea of the
atmospheric properties withing the meso-$\gamma$ and meso-$\beta$ scale.
\gls{NWP} offers a alternitive method to understand the dynamic properties
of the atmosphere over a larger spatial and temporal extent, however, this
requires powerful computer resources, especially to resolve convection.
Attempts to understand larger circulation (macro-$\beta$ scale) has similar
limitations, and although simulating convection is less challenging on a
synoptic scale with the use of parametrization schemes, it tends to
increase uncertainty. Clustering is a well known as often used method that
is computationally more efficient to understand large atmospheric
circulation patterns \citep{cahynova2014atmospheric, garcia2011atmospheric,
huth2008classifications, sheridan2011self}. This study attempts to use
these two methods to link the small and large scale systems with each other
and examine the relationship when extreme events are observed.

\section{The structure of thunderstorms, thermodynamic derived indicators and
wind shear}

Thunderstorms, defined as; 

\begin{quotation}
\textit{"a high frequency mesoscale system associated with vigorous
convection, giant towering and thundery cumulonimbus cloud, strong wind in
the form of squall, lightning flashes, and heavy rain, sometimes
accompanied with hail"} \citep{halder2015effect}, 
\end{quotation}

are small scale features that can invoke havoc on a regioni. A severe
thunderstorm can produce heavy rain, hail, severe winds, tornadoes (a rare
occurrence in South-Africa) and damaging lightning. Because these events
are short lived and develop rapidly it poses a challenge for atmospheric
scientists to understand the complex processes within these storms. The
smallest of these are isolated, single cell thunderstorms followed by
multicell storms; severe hail, lightning and rainfall is an possible
occurrence when any these convection types are present. The
most notable of thunderstorms is the supercell storm often extending over
30km and reaching heights of over 15km, these storms result in most extreme
weather related damage to regions \citep{rae2014supercell}. Thunderstorms
are sustained by updrafts; warm, moist air that feeds the system. As this
warm moist air rises latent heat is released and an air parcel buoyancy
increases and this, along with sustained updrafts lifts saturated air high
into the troposphere and lower stratosphere, in the process reaching
freezing levels where ice particles and supercooled droplets start forming.
The particles continue to grow in size until its weight exceeds the
strength of the updraft when finally down bursts of hail and heavy rainfall 
occur. \hyperref[fig:stormstructure]{Figure \ref{fig:stormstructure}}
provides a simple illustration of the thunderstorm structure.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/structure.png}
\caption[Simplified illustration of thunderstorm development]{Thunderstorms
form in a unstable atmosphere. As air rises, cools down, expands and
condensates it releases latent heat, this and results in increased
buoyancy of an air parcel. The increased buoyancy and strong updrafts
carries air high into the atmosphere; in a supercell this can exceed
20km in rare cases. As the saturated air rises it reaches freezing
levels where supercooled droplets and ice form, with a strong updraft these
particles remain suspended in the cloud and grow in size until the weight of
the particle overcomes the strength of the updraft and falls to surface in
the form of rain or hail.}
\label{fig:stormstructure}
\end{figure}

Understanding the thermodynamics of convection plays an important part in
understanding severe storm formation and through the use thermodynamic
diagrams scientists have been able to represent processes in the atmosphere
related to various atmospheric conditions including severe events such as
hailstorms. Research related to sounding derived severe storm climatologies
is relatively abundant for Europe
\citep{sanchez2003analysis,sanchez2009assessing,
berthet2013extreme,mohr2013recent,groenemeijer2007sounding} and
North-America
\citep{rasmussen1998baseline,dupilka2006forecasting,doswell2006use,allen2015empirical}.
Over South-Africa less so, \cite{dyson2009heavy, dyson2013atmospheric,
dyson2015baseline, rae2014supercell} work is the most extensive related to
the topic. \cite{dyson2015baseline} study focused on the use of sounding
derived parameters extended from 1977 - 2015, and found that severe
convective indices was mostly recorded during summer months, as expected,
with levels of \gls{CAPE} and wind shear comparable to that of severe
events observed the \gls{USA}.  \citep{rae2014supercell} had a similar
finding, showing that \gls{MUCAPE} values are the highest during Summer and
also noting the sudden increase in observed \gls{MUCAPE} from September to
October. Meteorological agencies typically lunch
two weather balloons, also known as soundings, daily at certain points to
gather atmospheric data, in South-Africa this occurs at Cape-Town and Irene
on a daily basis, while other sites have reduced the frequency of launches.
Indicators derived from these soundings are used to evaluate the
thermodynamic structure of the atmosphere and the possibility of severe
weather occurrence. \cite{sanchez2009assessing, johns1992severe} mentions
three \textit{ingredients} that indicate an environment ideal for storm
formation, this includes a moist deep layer in the low/mid troposphere,
instability and an triggering mechanism. The basic movement of a parcel of
air in an unstable environment can be summed up as follows: as a parcels is
lifted through a region of stable atmosphere it becomes saturated and
reaches the \gls{LCL} where clouds typically form. In an unstable
environment the parcel continues lifting to its \gls{LFC}, to achieve this
the parcel requires a certain amount of energy to \textit{break} trough the
stable atmosphere, known as \gls{CIN}. If a parcel is unstable it will
continue to rise to the \gls{EL}, where it has the same density to that of
the surrounding environment. When this occurs a parcel is said to be
positively buoyant, this represent by a function known as \gls{CAPE}.
\hyperref[fig:thermodiagram]{Figure \ref{fig:thermodiagram}} shows a simple
indication of how the thermodynamic properties of a rising parcel.
Meteorologists use soundings to evaluate these \textit{ingredients} and
this has led to the formation severe storm indices such as \gls{CAPE},
\gls{LI}, \gls{SWEAT}, \gls{VT}, \gls{TT} and various other derived
indices. Also measured from the soundings is vertical and horizontal wind
shear, low and upper level vertical shear is important in the storm
formation, however, strong shear can \textit{break} a storm and lead to its
demise. \hyperref[fig:hodo_structure]{Figure \ref{fig:hodo_structure}} the
use of an hodograph to plot and analyze the motion and shear in the
atmosphere. A couple of the indices mentioned stand out, the are briefly
discussed here (see \cite{groenemeijer2007sounding, sanchez2009assessing,
kaltenbock2009evaluation, dyson2015baseline, grieser2012convection,
de2000tornadic, tippett2015climate, litta2012numerical}). \gls{CAPE} is one
of the most common derivatives of soundings is formulated as,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cape}
CAPE = \int^{p_f}_{p_n} \left( a_p - a_e \right)dp,
\end{equation}

\gls{CAPE} is a theoretical measure of instability of the buoyancy of an
air parcel with an increase in height as it is heated adiabatically
(through the \gls{LCL}, \gls{LFC} until it reaches its \gls{EL}). If this
buoyancy is positive an environment conducive to storm formation can be
expected \citep{groenemeijer2007sounding, sanchez2009assessing}. \gls{CAPE}
values are expressed as $\frac{J}{kg}$ and values $<1000$ indicates
instability, although storms have been recorded in lower values. The
importance of \gls{CAPE} has been emphasized by
\cite{groenemeijer2007sounding, sanchez2009assessing,
kaltenbock2009evaluation} where a strong relationship was found between
\gls{CAPE}, thunderstorms and hail.  $\int^{p_f}_{p_n}$ represents the
parcel rising from the pressure at the level of free convection (LFC -
$p_f$), the pressure at the equilibrium level (\gls{EL} - $p_n$), $a_p$ the
volume of a parcel moving upwards moist-adiabatically from the LFC and
$a_e$ environment specific volume of the profile \citep{glossary2016ams}.
Other \gls{CAPE} derived indices include, \gls{SBCAPE}, \gls{NCAPE},
\gls{MLCAPE}, \gls{MUCAPE}, 3km \gls{CAPE} and integrated \gls{CAPE}.

\gls{CIN} is known as negative \gls{CAPE} and is a measure of the energy
that a parcel has overcome to rise above the stable inversion layer into the
atmosphere and become positively buoyant. \gls{CIN} is written as;

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cin}
CIN = \int^{LFC}_{\text{source level}} B_T dz = \int^{EL}_{\text{source level}}
\frac{T_v'}{\overline{T_v}} dz
\end{equation}

The \gls{SI} is a widely used severe storm evaluation index. The original
\gls{SI} \citep{showalter1953stability}, which is perhaps the first major
indicator derived from soundings \citep{doswell2006use}, is defined as the
temperature difference of an air parcel lifted from 850hPa
dry-adiabatically to its \gls{LCL} and then wet adiabtically to 500hPa.
This can be written as,

\begin{equation}
SI = PT_{500} - PT_{P_{500}}
\label{eq:si_i}
\end{equation}

where $PT_{P_{500}}$ is the parcel temperature at 500hPa when lifted
dry-adiabatically from 850hPa to the \gls{LCL} and then wet adiabatically
to 500mb. Positive \gls{SI} values ($\geq$0) indicate a stable atmosphere
and negative values (< 0) an unstable atmosphere.
\cite{tyson2000atmosphere} notes that a value of -3$\degree$C is
\textit{defining} conditions for cumulus formation. Similar to the \gls{SI}
is the \gls{LI} \citep{galway1956lifted} calculating the temperature
difference of a parcel as it is lifted dry-adiabatically to the \gls{LCL}
and the wet-adiabatically to 500hPa, but an important difference is the
\gls{LI} is calculated between the surface ($z=0$) and 500hPa.
	
Two other important indicators are derived from temperature and humidity.
First the \gls{TT} index; the \gls{TT} is formulated by combining the
\gls{VT} and \gls{CT}. The \gls{VT} is defined as temperature difference
between 850hPa and 500hPa while the CT is the difference between the 850hPa
dew-point temperature ($T_{d,850}$) and 500hPa temperature ($2T_{500}$).
The \gls{TT} can thus be written as \cite{grieser2012convection,
miller1972notes},

\begin{equation}
TT = VT + TT = T_{850} + T_{d,850} - 2T_{500},
\label{eq:TTI}
\end{equation}

when \gls{TT} values are $\geq$44K the environment has conditions that
could result in thunderstorm formation. The K-Index is similar to the
\gls{VT}, but includes temperature and dew-point temperature at 700hPa, the
K-Index is written as,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ki}
K = T_{850} - T_{500} + T_{d,850} - ( T_{700} + T_{d,700} )
\end{equation}

Another product derived from the upper air sounding and that has been shown
to have particular importance in severe storm formations is wind shear.
Wind shear is measure of the directional variations in the wind vector. The
vertical wind shear is a function of the speed (vertical speed shear) and
directional (vertical directional shear) changes of wind with an increase
in height when a parcel of air is lifted, this is represented on a
hodograph (see \hyperref[fig:hodo_structure]{figure
\ref{fig:hodo_structure}}). The vertical wind shear is calculated as a
magnitude of the vector difference between two pressure levels ($\Delta V =
V_{top} - V_{bottom}$), while horizontal wind shear refers to the lateral
change of wind direction at a given altitude \citep{barry2009atmosphere}.
The most common products derived from the hodograph is bulk shear,
represented ($\Delta V$) and mean shear ($\sum \Delta V$.
The bulk shear is mostly used to evaluate the 0 - 6km
levels. Another impact on storms is the direction wind shear. 
This influences a storm rotation and subsequent
lifting of air parcels, however, wind shear is not only related to storm
formation but also storm destruction. Strong shear can prevent the
evolution of cumulonimbus clouds by dispersing heat and moisture in the
upper atmosphere, revered to as shearing. In the Southern Hemisphere shear
associated with convective events typically have an counterclockwise
rotation, also known as backing \citep{doswell1991review}. \gls{SRH} and
\gls{EHI} are two other important indicators describing the wind
environment of supercells, according to \cite{thompson2007effective}
\gls{SRH} is the accepted driver of rotation within storms, the \gls{SRH}
is generally represented  in a fixed level, usually 0 - 1km, 0 - 3km or 0 -
6km, because \gls{SRH} is related to rotation it is mainly used to evaluate
tornado probability. \gls{SRH} is represented as,

\begin{equation}
SRH = - \int^h_0 \overrightarrow{k} \cdot (\overrightarrow{v} (z) - \overrightarrow{c}) \times \frac{\partial \overrightarrow{v}z}{\partial z}dz
\end{equation}	

where $\overrightarrow{k}$ is vertical unit vector, $\overrightarrow{c}$
moving velocity of the cell and $\overrightarrow{v}z$ the wind vector,
generally values $\geq$ 150 $m^2/s^2$ is associated with rotation capable
of generating thunderstorms, to represent the instability within these
systems \gls{EHI} is used, \gls{EHI} is derived from \gls{CAPE} and
\gls{SRH} as, 

\begin{equation}
EHI = \frac{CAPE \cdot SHR}{160,000},
\end{equation}

typically values > 1 indicates environment suitable for thunderstorm
development. Related to the wind shear and \gls{CAPE} environment is the
\gls{BRN}. The \gls{BRN} is a function of the buoyant energy (\gls{CAPE})
and the wind shear relationship \citep{de2000tornadic,
thompson2007effective}. The \gls{BRN} can be used to identity different
thunderstorm types, the \gls{BRN} is written as,

\begin{equation}
BRN = \frac{CAPE}{\frac{1}{2}(v_1 - v_2)^2},
\end{equation}

where $v_1$ and  $v_2$ are wind speeds at 500m and 6km respectively
\citep{grieser2012convection}. Ideal values for thunderstorm formation is
between 10 and 45, a weak shear environment is unable to sustain a storm,
while too high values can \textit{tear} a storm apart.

structure of a typical thunderstorm adapted from \cite{cairo2011atmospheric}
illustrates some of the key concepts that influence thunderstorm
formation; as a parcel of air rises it reaches the \gls{LCL} where saturation
occurs, the parcel is then lifted wet adiabtically.
In an unstable atmosphere the parcel continues to rise to the \gls{LFC}.
Between the \gls{LCL} and \gls{LFC} is a region of stable atmosphere,
to \textit{break} through this stable region requires a certain amount of energy
known as \gls{CIN}. Once the parcel breaks through this stable region it can continue to
rise until it reaches the \gls{EL}. If it is positively buoyant \gls{CAPE}
can be used as a measure of instability.}

Two major data sources exist where radiosonde data can be
accessed, the \gls{UWYO} database is a well known resource containing
realtime radiosonde data from across the world, the database allows for
easy plotting of raw upper-air sounding data in the form of hodographs,
thephigrams, skew-t or even the rarely used stuve diagram. The data does
not undergo any quality control before release. A manual quality control
procedure has to be undertaken before data is used. The other source is the
\gls{IGRA} which contains historical radiosonde data for weather stations
around the world. The \gls{IGRA} data undergoes a quality control procedure
before released \citep{durre2008robust, durre2006overview}.
\cite{dyson2013atmospheric} however cautions about the use of the
\gls{IGRA} dataset as errors related to dew-point calculations have been
noted.  

The use of upper-air soundings allow meteorologist to form a better idea of the
state of the atmosphere and evaluate the possibility of
severe events probability. Although the use of indicators is
valuable they they are prone to errors, some more than others. According to
\cite{doswell2006use, markowski2003characteristics}, the combination of various
indicators should be used as an assistance to meteorologist and not a
replacement. 

\section{Synoptic weather of South-Africa}
\label{sec:southafricaclimate}

South-Africa's location in the middle latitudes (22\degree – 35\degree S
and 15\degree – 35\degree E) and the surrounding Indian and Atlantic ocean
has a profound impact on circulation patterns occurring over the country.
South-Africa has a dominantly semi-arid climate \citep{engelbrecht2013high,
dyson2015baseline}.  According to the Köppen-Geiger Climate Classification
System the majority of Gauteng falls into the Cwb climate region, warm
temperate, winter dry and warm summer.  Smaller areas are classified into
Cwa, warm temperate, winter dry and hot summer, and Bsh, arid, summer dry
and hot arid, regions \citep{kottek2006world}.  The province receives
between 600mm - 700mm rainfall per year, mostly during the summer from
isolated convective thunderstorms \citep{dyson2009heavy, fatti2011science}.
Gauteng is mostly in a state of fine and dry weather due to the prevailing
continental high-pressure system \citep{tyson2000atmosphere,
roy2013spatial} in winter month.  During summertime the systems gives way
to the tropical low pressure from the \gls{ITCZ} which extends down central
South Africa from late spring (October) until December. The \gls{ITCZ} is a
source of deep convection, associated with thunderstorms and hailstorms
\citep{de1998heavy}, these mesoscale weather systems often results in short
lived, heavy, isolated rainfall in the region, accompanied by strong winds
and hail \citep{dyson2009heavy}.  The three systems mentioned (continental
anticyclone, \gls{ITCZ} and easterly wave circulation) have a profound
impact on Gauteng's weather throughout the year.

The weather and subsequent climate is dominated by a
prevailing anticyclonic circulation at 850 hPa over the subcontinent that
brings about strong subsidence over the interior of the country
\citep{piketh1999lower}. Several circulation patterns that influence South
Africa's weather and climate have a strong seasonal variation, with
characteristic weather types during the summer and winter months (see
\hyperref[fig:weathertypes]{figure \ref{fig:weathertypes}}).

The continental anticyclone and the tropical easterly disturbances follow a
clear seasonal cycle (\hyperref[fig:weathertypes]{figure \ref{fig:weathertypes},
bottom right}). Summer weather is characterized by the presence of the
South-Atlantic High and the South-Indian High surrounding mainland and
a shallow heat low over the interior of the country. The \gls{ITCZ} shifts
approximately 17\degree S during this time, resulting in tropical
weather over the northern parts of the country. These systems lead to isolated
convective systems, also known as easterly low pressure systems, \gls{TTT} or
tropical disturbances in the easterlies
\citep{dyson2002model}(\hyperref[fig:weathertypes]{figure
\ref{fig:weathertypes}, top left}). With the advent of winter these systems move
towards the equator and a prevailing high pressure system sets in over the
interior of the country leading to fine and dry weather over the interior of
South-Africa, which is brought about by the continental anticyclone
(\hyperref[fig:weathertypes]{figure \ref{fig:weathertypes}, top right}), a
synoptic system dominated by subsiding air \citep{tyson2000atmosphere,
roy2013spatial, engelbrecht2013high}. Other synoptic systems which occur less
frequently include westerly waves (\hyperref[fig:weathertypes]{figure
\ref{fig:weathertypes}, middle left}), the ridging anticyclone
(\hyperref[fig:weathertypes]{figure \ref{fig:weathertypes}, middle right})
and cut-off lows (\hyperref[fig:weathertypes]{figure
\ref{fig:weathertypes}, bottom left}) \citep{tyson2000atmosphere, tyson1986climatic}.

\cite{tyson2000atmosphere, dyson2013atmospheric} identified westerly trough,
cold fronts, southward extending tropical low or V-shaped trough, the cut-off
low, tropical cyclones, ridging high and blocking high or long wave ridge as the
most important systems that influence summer rainfall in South-Africa. During
the winter the South Atlantic high pressure system and the associated westerly
disturbances (mid-latitude fronts) results in winter rainfall over the southern
point of the country. South Africa's climate and weather is also influenced by
fronts originating in the temperate latitudes below its southern point
\citep{preston1973note, tyson1986climatic, tyson2000atmosphere}, furthermore,
the eastern escarpment, its abrupt rise and the \gls{SO}, which drives the El
Nino and La Nina phenomena, are other well known factors impacting the country's
climate and weather \citep{preston1973note, hastenrath1995prediction}. Climate
change predictions for South-Africa estimate that there may be an increase in
extreme convective events, resulting heavy rainfall, flooding and possibly more
severe hailstorms, while a temperature increase of $4\degree$C is projected for
Gauteng and the northern parts of the country \citep{engelbrecht2013high,
piketh2014climate}.

circulation patterns of South-Africa adapted from \cite{tyson1986climatic}. The
lower right graph shows the distinct cycle between the tropical easterlies
(summer) and the continental anticyclone (winter) patterns. With the advent of
summer the tropical easterlies reach South-Africa. This is associated with the
easterly wave and low that brings warm moist air from the tropics to over the
country and results in an increase of convective activity. The continental
anticyclone is most dominant during the winter, when the Highveld weather is
characterized by fine and dry weather.  The coastal low impact on Highveld
weather is less profound; these systems mostly effect the coastal regions of
South-Africa. The westerly wave brings cold, rainy weather to the Southern Cape
during winter \citep{tyson1986climatic, tyson2000atmosphere}.}

\subsection{Hailstorms over South-Africa}

Often lasting only a few minutes and invoking havoc on a region, the high
spatial and temporal variability of hailstorms has presented challenges for
scientist studying these events \citep{carte1978variability,
sanderson2015projected}. Part of this variability can be attributed to
seasonality, topography, urban effects and altitude \citep{tyson2000atmosphere}.
Understanding conditions leading up to hailstorms are important due to the
devastation of these events.

Cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds are generally associated with hail formation.
The turbulent air currents in clouds force water particles in the clouds to move
upwards to freezing levels and as soon as the water freezes the nucleus of the
hailstone is formed. Gravity forces the hailstone downwards, if the hailstone
are not heavy enough it may be carried upwards again and grow in size until the
hailstones can no longer be upheld by updrafts and fall to the ground
\citep{heymsfield1980hail, foote1984study}. 
	
Over Gauteng, hailstorms usually peak from October to December, but storms are
observed as late as March and early April. Most severe thunderstorms are also
observed during the October - December period \citep{olivier1992impact}.
According to \cite{cecil2012toward} hail is observed on 38\% of days during a
six-month hail season. While the region has around 75 thunderstorm days in this
period there occurs aaround 5 hail days at anyone point per year. The average
number of hail producing storm cells can exceed 7 on a hail day over Gauteng.
The average time of an hail event over the Witwatersrand area around is 7.3
minutes \citep{mader1986some, tyson2000atmosphere, tyson1986climatic}.

To better understand the large scale influences on hail
\cite{held1979hailstorms} looked at different synoptic situations giving
rise to a variety of hailstorms during 1975 within the Johannesburg area.
\cite{held1979hailstorms} found that the conditions for hail days were not
much different from days with normal thunderstorm activity – usually
characterized by a trough or low pressure system over central South-Africa,
cyclonic conditions are favored during hail producing storms up to 500mb
\citep{olivier1989some}.  \cite{held1979hailstorms} notes that
high-pressure systems from the south-west following a cold front can result
in even more severe hailstorms than normal thunderstorm producing
conditions. According to \cite{olivier1989some} line storms along squall
lines are linked with severe hail damage, but accounts for less hail fall
than scattered and isolated thunderstorms over the Highveld.
	
The \gls{HDF}\footnote{\gls{HDF} refers to the probability of a hail event to
occur on a certain point within a year} in South-Africa is at its highest
between the latitudes of 25\degree E and 28\degree S, with \gls{HDF} lowering
towards the tropics and the Antarctic. The two biggest cities at these latitudes
are Johannesburg (26\degree E) and Pretoria (25\degree E)
\citep{schulze1965hail, le1996modelling}. Johannesburg and Pretoria also have
the most reported severe hailstorms in the country. Between 1911-2012
Johannesburg and Pretoria ahd far more reports of severe hail events than any other
city in the country \citep{bureau1991history}. \cite{cecil2012toward} makes an
important note of an area's population density bias on hail reports; larger
cities or metropolitan areas such as Johannesburg and Pretoria have a higher
likelihood of hail actually being reported. Altitude and urban areas also
influence the \gls{HDF}. Locations at higher altitudes have a higher \gls{HDF},
even when these locations are in relative close proximity to each other e.g.
Pretoria and Witwatersrand. The \gls{HDF} is greater in Witwatersrand than the
lower-lying Pretoria \citep{held1979hailstorms}. Urban areas have a higher
\gls{HDF} than the neighboring rural areas. Urban effects like may have an
impact on \gls{HDF}, possibly more than the topographic changes between the rural and
urban areas. Not much research exist on this topic and it could form the basis for future studies to understand the
urban effects on severe storms in South-Africa \citep{carte1978variability,
olivier1992impact}. \hyperref[fig:hdfolivier]{Figure \ref{fig:hdfolivier}}
provides a well represented indication of the annual hail frequency. Isolated
areas within the Highveld and the Eastern Cape also have a high \gls{HDF}, due
to Gauteng's high population density and urban extend these storms cause more
damage in the region. Although the damage in smaller towns and to farmers may be
proportionally higher, media attention towards areas with an important social
economic stance such as Johannesburg gives it a high \textit{reporting
priority}.
	
There an important relationship between the occurrence of thunderstorms and
hail events. Lesotho and the surrounding Drakensburg mountains experience
the highest \gls{HDF} and thunderstorm events, exceeding 100 days per year
\cite{tyson2000atmosphere}. These results are support by
\cite{cecil2012toward} research into the worldwide distribution of hail by
use of the \gls{AMSR-E} estimated a higher number of events during the
South-African hail season around Lesotho while decreasing towards the
Highveld. \cite{cecil2012toward} observations also supports that of
\cite{olivier1992impact, held1979hailstorms, carte1978variability,
schulze1965hail} whose findings show that most of South-Africa's hailstorms
occur in October, November and December, when convective activity is at its
highest over the Highveld. However, remote sensing data such as the
\gls{AMSR-E} is prone to errors. According to \cite{li2016hail} data
derived from satellites have a course temporal and spatial resolution
leading to some distortion in the representation of hail distribution.
Instances of hail in Western Cape region are also observed in the
Mountainous areas around in the region, however, these events are not
typically of a convective nature, such as Highveld events
\citep{tyson2000atmosphere}. \cite{schulze1965hail, tyson2000atmosphere}
(\hyperref[fig:hdfshulze]{figure \ref{fig:hdfshulze}} found a similar
spatial distribution as that of \cite{le1996modelling} 
(\hyperref[fig:hdfolivier]{figure \ref{fig:hdfshulze}}).

such the area is densely populated and hail events often result in extreme
damage over the region. Locations in the tropics, South and Western Africa receive
similar amounts of hail events, while other areas in the mid-latitudes in the Northern

\section{Applying NWP to predict mesos-$\gamma$ scale features}

Although the idea behind \gls{NWP} was already conceptualized in 1904 by Vilhelm
Bjerknes the lack of computational technology at the time limited development.
Lewis Fry Richardson later theorized the workflow necessary for a
\gls{NWP} system and developed a horizontal grid system similar to
modern systems in use today \citep{kimura2002numerical}. Richardson envisioned
\textit{"forecast factory"} where 64,000 people acting as calculators would form
a \gls{NWP} system \citep{charlton2011lewis}. Luckily Richardson didn't have to
find 64,000 people because in 1946 the Electronic Computer Project was put into
place by John Von Neumann at the \gls{IAS} and by 1958 the first operational
model, a single level barotropic model, was brought into service
\citep{shuman1989history}. The following year (1959) Japan introduced it's own
\gls{NWP} infrastructure \citep{kimura2002numerical} and these early advances set
the tone for further development of \gls{NWP} infrastructure. South-Africa
followed suit not long after, the first \gls{NWP} was in development in the 1960's
and operational by 1970 \citep{triegaardt1962application,
schulze2007atmospheric, triegaardt1965experimental}. More recently
\cite{engelbrecht2007development} developed South-Africa's first nonhydrostatic
model.

In the most simplest of forms the prediction of weather can be represented by
the equation

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial X}{\partial t} = F(X)
\end{equation}

where $\partial X$ represents the change of a given variable at a specific point
in space, $\partial t$ the change in time and $F(X)$ the cumulative effect of
processes that change the value of $X$. From this basic equation we can calculate 
meteorological change in time by including the variable's initial condition and calculating 
the forcing acting upon the variable over a given time period, this is written as:

\begin{equation}
X^{forecast} = X^{initial} + F(X) \partial t
\end{equation}

The above mentioned equations form the most simplest of \gls{NWP} equations.
Today most numerical models are based on the primitive equations describing the
state and changes in the atmosphere by using equations for conservation of
motion, energy, mass and moisture \citep{tyson2000atmosphere}. These can be
written as,

the equation for motion,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} -v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} -w \frac{\partial u}{\partial p} -u \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} + fv + F_x,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} -v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} -w \frac{\partial v}{\partial p} -u \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} - fv + F_x,
\end{equation}		

where $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}$
describes the changes in vertical ($v$) and horizontal ($u$) velocity with
respect to time ($t$). The equations are solved by using the equation for motion
($-u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} -v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$),
calculating the local change of the $u$ and $v$ components of velocity with
upward movement ($-w \frac{\partial u}{\partial p}$), the rate of change of the
geopotential force in zonal and meridional directions ($\frac{\partial
\phi}{\partial x}$), the Coriolis force also acting in the zonal and meridional
direction ($f v$) and surface stress and the effects of eddy viscosity ($F_x$)
\citep{tyson2000atmosphere}.
		
The hydrostatic equilibrium to calculate the change in vertical acceleration as,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial p} = - \frac{RT}{p},
\end{equation}

where $p$ refers to pressure, $RT$ the gas constant of dry air at a given
temperature. 
	
The conservation of energy,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} -v \frac{\partial T}{\partial y} + w \left( \frac{R}{C_p} \frac{T}{p}	- \frac{\partial T}{\partial p} \right) + \frac{H}{C_p}
\end{equation}

calculates local changes in temperature ($\partial T$) as a function of
horizontal advection ($\partial x$) and vertical changes ($\partial y$) as a
result of surface heat, and diabatic latent-heat released during condensation
over time ($\partial t$) \citep{tyson2000atmosphere}.

Continuity,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial w}{\partial t} = - \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right),
\end{equation}

relates to convergence and divergence of air parcels. According to
\cite{tyson2000atmosphere} the continuity equations states that changes in the
$u$ and $v$ components of wind must be balanced by an equal change in the $w$
component in a $z$ direction. In this case ($\frac{\partial w}{\partial t}$)
refers to the change of an air parcel over time and in the horizontal ($u$) and
($v$) components for wind in the $x$ and $y$ direction.

For moisture conservation,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial q}{\partial t} = w \frac{\partial q}{\partial p} + \left( u \frac{\partial q}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial q}{\partial y} \right) + C = 0.
\end{equation}	

where ($w \frac{\partial q}{\partial p}$) is a function of convection and ($u
\frac{\partial q}{\partial x}$), to advection with the inclusion of changes
associated with condensation \citep{tyson2000atmosphere}
	
and sigma coordinates,
	
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{p}{p_s}.
\end{equation}		
	
According to \cite{tyson2000atmosphere} a minimum of two levels is necessary to
form a baroclinic model describing mid-latitude disturbances.

The non-hydrostatic approach to weather and climate modeling is a relatively new
and evolved with the advancement of computational resources. Non-hydrostatic
equations allow \gls{NWP} models to simulate mesoscale phenomenons such as
convection with better accuracy at high resolutions and retain a complete
representation of the Coriolis force \citep{saito2007nonhydrostatic}. The basic
equations can be written as, after \cite{saito2007nonhydrostatic},

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:momentum}
\frac{\partial \textbf{v}}{\partial t} = - \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p -g\textbf{k}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:continuinty}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} = - \rho \nabla \cdot \textbf{v}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:thermodynamic}
\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} = \frac{Q}{C_p \pi}
\end{equation}
	
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:state}
p = \rho RT
\end{equation}	
	
these equations omit the Coriolis force. $T$ is temperature, $p$ is pressure and
$\rho$ is density. As with the primitive equations wind is represented by
$u,v,w$. $\textbf{v}$ represents the wind vector and $g$ gravity acceleration,
$R$ the gas constant for dry air, $Q$ adiabatic heating, $C_p$ specific heat of
dry at constant pressure and $\textbf{k}$ unit vector in vertical direction
\citep{saito2007nonhydrostatic}. $\pi$ represents the Exner
equation\footnote{conservation of mass} as,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exnerstate}
\pi = \left( \frac{p}{p_0} \right)^{R/Cp},
\end{equation} 

where $p_0$ is the reference pressure (100 hpa). $\theta$, potential temperature, is represented as;

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:potentiatemp}
\theta = \frac{T}{\pi}.
\end{equation}

This allows momentum to be represented as

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \textbf{v}}{dt} = -C_p \theta \nabla \pi - g \textbf{k},
\end{equation}

with the relation

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + \textbf{v} \cdot \nabla A,
\end{equation}

the continuity equation is rewritten in flux form as,

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:conflux}
\rho \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial_{\rho} A}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho A \textbf{v})
\end{equation}	

With the integration of the momentum equation
(\hyperref[eq:momentum]{\ref{eq:momentum}}), the continuity equation in flux
form (\hyperref[eq:conflux]{\ref{eq:conflux}}) and the equation of state
(\hyperref[eq:exnerstate]{\ref{eq:exnerstate}}), the momentum equation can be
rewritten as,

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \rho \textbf{V}}{\partial t} + \textbf{adv} + \nabla p = - \rho g \textbf{k},
\end{equation}		
	
where advection ($\textbf{adv}$) is represented in flux form. To retain large
scale features within non-hydrostatic models the hydrostatic approximation
run-time option is available \citep{skamarock2008description} and written as, 

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} = - \rho g,
\end{equation}	

and replaces the vertical momentum equations.

Throughout the development of \gls{NWP} models, \gls{RCM} came into development.
\gls{RCM} allowed the for scientific research at a much higher resolution than
other models \citep{prein2013added}. \gls{WRF} is the one of the most recent
models to show success at regional and high resolution simulations and is
implemented in this study to simulate case studies of extreme hail events.

\subsection{The Weather Research and Forecasting Model}

\gls{WRF} was developed as a community model by the \gls{NCAR} for the
simulation and forecasting of regional weather
\citep{bukovsky2009precipitation}. The model was created to improve the
previously used \gls{MM5} and the Eta-\gls{NWP} model. The model is a
non-hydrostatic, fully comprehensible and terrain following sigma coordinate
model. \gls{WRF} can be used for idealized simulations, parameterization
research, data assimilation, forecasting, real-time numerical weather
prediction, hurricane research, air-quality modeling, ocean-atmosphere coupling
and regional climate research \citep{skamarock2008description}.

\gls{WRF} uses a terrain following hydrostatic pressure vertical
coordinate ($\eta$) defined as:

\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{(\rho_h - \rho_{ht})}{\mu},
\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}
\mu = \rho_{hs} = \rho_{ht}.
\end{equation}

where $\rho_h$ represents the the hydrostatic component of pressure
\citep{skamarock2008description}, $\rho_{hs}$ the hydrostatic surface values
and $\rho_{ht}$ the hydrostatic values at the boundary top. \gls{WRF}'s
governing equations are based on the flux-form Euler equations
\citep{skamarock2008description}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:horizontalmomentum}
\partial_t U + (\nabla \cdot \textbf{V}u) - \partial_x (\rho \phi_\eta) + \partial_\eta (\rho \phi_x) = F_U,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:horizontalmomentum2}
\partial_t V + (\nabla \cdot \textbf{V}v) - \partial_y (\rho \phi_\eta) + \partial_\eta (\rho \phi_y) = F_V,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:vericalmomentum}
\partial_t W + (\nabla \cdot \textbf{V}w) - g (\partial_{\eta \rho} - \mu) = F_W,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:conservationoftemp}
\partial_t \Theta + (\nabla \cdot \textbf{V} \theta) = F_\Theta,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:conservationofdryair}
\partial_t \mu + (\nabla \cdot \textbf{V}) = 0,
\end{equation}		

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:geopotential}
\partial_t \phi + \mu^{-1} [(V \cdot \nabla \phi) -gW] = 0,
\end{equation}		

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:inverse}
\partial_\mu \phi = - \alpha \mu,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:WRFstate}
\rho = \rho_0 (R_d \Theta / \rho_0 \alpha)^\gamma.
\end{equation}		

Equation \hyperref[eq:horizontalmomentum]{\ref{eq:horizontalmomentum}} and
\ref{eq:horizontalmomentum2} are the horizontal momentum equations,
\hyperref[eq:vericalmomentum]{\ref{eq:vericalmomentum}} the vertical momentum
equation, \hyperref[eq:conservationoftemp]{\ref{eq:conservationoftemp}} the
conservation of potential temperature,
\hyperref[eq:conservationoftemp]{\ref{eq:conservationoftemp}} the conservation
of dry air, \hyperref[eq:geopotential]{\ref{eq:geopotential}} geopotential,
\hyperref[eq:inverse]{\ref{eq:inverse}} the equation of inverse density and
\hyperref[eq:WRFstate]{\ref{eq:WRFstate}} the equation of state.
\hyperref[eq:geopotential]{Equation \ref{eq:geopotential}} is the only
non-conservative equation in governing equations. $\textbf{V}$, is the three
dimensional coupled vector velocities, $F$ forcing term for $U$, $V$, $W$ and
$\Theta$, $\rho$ pressure and $\rho_0$ sea-level reference pressure, $\alpha$
the inverse density of dry air , $\mu$ pressure difference between the surface
and model top, $\phi$ geoptential, $\Theta$ coupled potential temprature, $g$
acceleration as a function of gravity, $\eta$ terrain following
hydrostatic-pressure vertical coordinate, $R_d$ the gas constant for fry air,
$\gamma$ heat capacity for dry air at a constant pressure (as a ratio), $U$, the
coupled horizontal component of velocity in the x-direction, $V$ the coupled
horizontal component of velocity in the y-direction, $W$ the coupled vertical
component of velocity, $u$ the horizontal component of velocity in the
x-direction, $v$ the horizontal component of velocity in the y-direction and $w$
the vertical component of velocity \citep{skamarock2008description}. The
variables are further redefined to include perturbation variables, map
projections, parametrized physics and Coriolis terms that are subsequently
solved by the \gls{WRF} model \citep{skamarock2008description}	

Using \gls{WRF} to simulate severe storms has produced positive results in
previous studies. \cite{kumar2008analysis} applied \gls{WRF} to simulate a
severe rainfall event in Mumbai 2005 which led to large economic and human
losses for the region. The operational models used couldn't provide an
accurate forecast at the time and contributed to the loss suffered.
\gls{WRF} was able to reproduce the storm and identify factors contributing
to the development of the storm. \cite{berthet2013extreme} applied
\gls{WRF} to examine the climatology of hail in the South-West of France
and was able to successfully examine conditions leading up to hailstorms in
the region – through \gls{WRF} \cite{berthet2013extreme} found simultaneous
low-level, mid-level and high-level forcing and the presence of low
pressure systems over Portugal and/or Ireland contributes to severe hail
for the area. \gls{WRF} research over South-Africa has been more focused on
rainfall, much like other meteorological research over South-Africa
\citep{olivier1992impact}. Work by \cite{cretat2012uncertainties,
ratnam2013dynamical, ratna2014performance, maisha2014WRF,
nikulin2012precipitation} mainly focused on assessing the ability of
\gls{WRF} to simulate precipitation over the sub-continent. The work of
\cite{ratna2014performance} provides valuable insight into the way
convective parameterizations are resolved over South-Africa. Because
cumulus parameterizations are major source of error in models this is
useful to understand the uncertainties associated with particular schemes.

\gls{WRF} has several other advantages; the model has the ability to run at
high resolutions, provided adequate computing resources. This allows the
model resolve weather features at various scales. Various parameterization
schemes are also available to users, and users have the advantage of using
accessing \gls{WRF} source code and applying their own configurations as
necessary.

\subsubsection{WRF as a convective permitting model}
\label{subsec:modelscales}

Traditionally three major scales existed in atmospheric modeling; (1)
global, (2) regional and (3) mesoscale models
(\hyperref[fig:scalesinatmopshere]{Figure \ref{fig:scalesinatmopshere}}).
These scales are also simulated by models baring a similar name; \gls{GCM},
\gls{RCM} and \gls{MMM} respectively. Further improvement in computer
resources led to the development of \gls{CPM}, where deep convection within
the atmosphere is modeled explicitly without convective parameterization
schemes. The method is applied on scales lower than 4km -- the lower
meso-$\gamma$ and the upper micro-$\alpha$ as described by
\citep{orlanski1975rational}. According to \cite{weisman1997resolution}
parameterizing convection is a must when model resolutions exceed 20km.
\cite{prein2013added, segele2013weather} states that at resolutions between
8km - 12km convection is still reasonably well simulated by
parameterization schemes, but under 4km resolutions deep convection
parameterization schemes has been shown to account for large errors within
models \citep{prein2015review, trapero2013numerical, segele2013weather}.
Convective permitting models are key to accurately simulating storms that
result in hail and as mentioned. Over South-Africa and other parts of the
world hail is mostly formed during intense convective storms
\citep{cao2008severe}, however, the field remains relatively
unexplored in South-African research \citep{eckardt2013nature,
halder2015effect, blamey2013role}.

According to \cite{prein2015review} four types of \gls{CPM} models
currently exist, each with its own approach and application to different
scales in the atmosphere. The first approach, which is used in this study,
is known as the limited area modeling; generally a specific area is
selected for the simulation, this area is usually larger domain over a
"smaller" region e.g. a province covering an municipality. This allows the
model to downscale input data from the parent to the nested domain. This
approach is particularly useful for simulations of severe weather events
\citep{prein2015review}. The second approach is a global \gls{CPM}
approach, with \textit{seamless} integration from the convective to global
scale \citep{prein2015review}. Massive computational resources is required
to run such as model which makes the cost outweigh the benefits.
\citep{prein2015review} predicts that this may well change within the next
decade. The third approach also attempts to incorporate \gls{CPM} into a
global circulation model, but instead utilizes superparameterizations
\citep{prein2015review}, the computational cost of this approach still
exceeds more traditional GCM's but according to \cite{prein2015review} it
is $10^6$ less computationally expensive than the second approach. Similar
to the limited area modeling approach, the forth \gls{CPM} technique
utilizes stretched-grid domains. This allows for an area with a higher
grid-spacing to be nested within the model, the larger area is usually
lower in resolution which increases computational efficiency.

\gls{CPM} simulations have seen limited use in Africa and South-Africa.
From a South-African perspective this could be due to the lack of computer
resources before the recent introduction of the Center for High-Performance
Computing in Cape-Town. \cite{prein2015review} mentions two \gls{CPM}
studies over Africa, these were over Kilimanjaro \citep{molg2011new} and
the second over Sub-Sahara West African Region \citep{lauwaet2010impact}.
\cite{molg2011new} downscaled his model run from synoptic scale (39km) to a
convective scale of 813m over the Kilimanjaro region. Although
\cite{molg2011new} focused on glacier atmosphere interactions, the success
of his study in encouraging for other areas of atmospheric research. Over
South-Africa \cite{engelbrecht2007development} introduced the
Non-hydrostatic Sigma Model (NSM) using convective parameterization schemes
at resolutions where convection can be partially resolved. Convective scale
assessments on severe storms over South-Africa is clearly a field with
potential for research development to better understand severe weather
events.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../figures/scales.png}
\caption[Scales in atmospheric modeling]{Adapted from \cite{prein2013added}, the
figure shows the spatial and temporal scales within atmospheric
modeling; \gls{GCM} (>100km), \gls{RCM} (>12km) and \gls{CPM} (<4km).
Parameterizations play an important role in numerical models. When a feature
occurs on a sub-gridscale within the model it is necessary to
parametrize the feature to accurately represent it.
With the improvement in computer resources the resolution that can be
achieved with \gls{NWP} has increased. Convective permitting models are
the most recent of these, when modeling at scales of less <4km  is is
advantageous to turn cumulus parameterization off and model convection
explicitly. The inserts in the figure indicate processes that typically
occurs within a certain atmospheric scale, microscale turbulence, cumulus convection, cumulonimbus
convection, cyclone waves and planetary waves}
\label{fig:scalesinatmopshere}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{The role and interactions of parameterization schemes}

Due to the complexity of the atmosphere the direct simulations of physical
processes are difficult. Simplifications of these processes are made in
order to make models computationally effective especially when these
processes occur on a sub-grid scale. These \textit{simplification} are
known as parameterization schemes \citep{tyson2000atmosphere,
stensrud2009parameterization}. \gls{WRF} has a database of several schemes
ranging from simple computationally inexpensive schemes to complicated,
resource expensive schemes. Processes resolved by parameterization schemes
in \gls{WRF} include microphysics, short and long wave radiation,
convective processes, \gls{PBL} and land surface processes.

The parameterization of hail requires some special considerations;
parameterization schemes must be able to distinguish between hail, snow,
freezing rain and other ice species. Progress has been made with the
development of \gls{CPM} models and models are able to represent the
different hydrometeor species better, however, hail usually associated with
convective storms remains hard to simulate. According to
\cite{sanderson2015projected} parameterization schemes usually over- or
underestimate hail during severe storms as convective parameterizations are
not able to distinguished hydrometeors at this scale accurately.
Improvement is observed when omitting convective schemes and allowing
models to explicitly simulate storms. Other parameterizations still need to
be included all the parametrization schemes are interlinked with each other
(\hyperref[fig:wrfparameterization]{figure \ref{fig:wrfparameterization}}).
A brief description of the most important parameterizations and their basic
functions follows in this section. The full physics of the schemes selected for this study
is discussed in the data and methods section.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../figures/wrfparameterization.png}
\caption[Direct Interactions of parameterizations]{\gls{WRF} has a
database of several parameterizations available to users. The most important of
these are the microphysics, radiation, cumulus, land-surface and pla    netary
boundary layer (\gls{PBL}) schemes. The parameterizations simplify processes
within \gls{WRF} that occurs on a sub-gridscale and are not explicitly modeled,
but, these parameterizations account for uncertainties within \gls{WRF} and
other numerical models. The ability to explicitly model convection has improved
models but there are still various other processes that occur on a sub-gridscale
that requires parameterizing \citep{dudhia2014overview}.}
\label{fig:wrfparameterization}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Microphysics parametrization in WRF}

Microphysics parameterization allow models to solve processes related to the
evolution of particles such as ice, rain, snow, graupel and is able 
represent aerosols impact on cloud formation. This plays an important role in
the representation of short lived events such as convective storms, but the
complicated nature of such events and the underlying processes account for
a major source
of uncertainty within models \citep{stensrud2009parameterization,
halder2015effect, lee2005physical}. Differentiating between hail and other ice
species is a complicated process based on assumptions on air temperature, 
freezing levels, cloud levels and droplet size. Generally water vapor is allowed
to change form following an auto-conversion table, depending
on the temperature the water vapor can either condensate, freeze, sublimate or
ice and water particles can coexist within a cloud. Depending on the
vertical profile and position in a cloud various of these forms exists and
consistently change form. Assumptions are then made on how these particles
interact individually and with each other in different conditions. The
microphysics scheme must be able to solve Bergeon process, coalescence-collision
and the phase change from liquid to ice and back to liqiud again as the particle
moves \citep{thompson2008explicit, wobrock2003comparison,
stensrud2009parameterization}. A full explanation of the physics for the scheme
used in the study is described in the data and methods section.
	
\gls{WRF} has a total of 17 Microphysics schemes included availible to the user,
depending on the computational resources and processes the user is interested in
simulating. Microphysical processes interact with the other physics in the
model, changes in altitude, radiation, temperature and topography all have an
effect on cloud forming processes \citep{skamarock2008description}.
\hyperref[fig:microphysics]{Figure \ref{fig:microphysics}
\citep{dudhia2014overview}} indicates various physical processes that the
microphysics schemes have to resolve within models.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../figures/microphysics.png}
\caption[Microphysical processes parameterized in the WRF model]{A
representation of the microphysical processes parameterized in the \gls{WRF}
model after \cite{dudhia2014overview}. Microphysics parameterization are
important to represent different particles, their formation and interaction with
each other in the atmosphere. Particles are never in a fixed form and as such
microphysics schemes have to be able to represent this form change, often
multiple times over and back and forth.} 
\label{fig:microphysics}
\end{figure}
	
\paragraph{Short and long wave radiation parametrization in \gls{WRF}}

According to \cite{stensrud2009parameterization} radiation is the main driver of
atmospheric circulation patterns around the world. Along with
microphysics parameterizations is computationally more expansive than other
parametrized processes \citep{thompson2016explicitly}. \gls{WRF} allows the user
to select between incoming shortwave and outgoing long wave radiation schemes,
and has 8 and 6 schemes available to users respectively. The radiation schemes
have to incorporate functions for absorption and scattering by different
particles and aerosols present in the atmosphere. The radiation scheme also
interacts with clouds, vegetation, snow and soil parameters to define albedo,
absorption and scattering. This in return impacts surface heating and the
evolution of \gls{PBL}, crucial to cloud formation and surface atmosphere
interactions \citep{gero2006impact}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../figures/radiationbudget.png}
\caption[The global energy budget]{The earth's energy budget adapted from
\cite{intergovernmental2007fourth} indicates  the various processes resolved
within the Radiation scheme. Incoming and outgoing radiations as well as their
interaction with the land surface scheme and clouds, especially cumulus clouds,
plays a crucial part in the formation of the \gls{PBL}'s diurnal variation and
convective storms.}
\label{fig:radiationbudget} 
\end{figure}
	
\paragraph{Land surface model}
	
\gls{LSM} allows numerical models to include surface energy, water budget,
vegetation, green fraction, soil, sub soil properties and their interaction with
atmospheric processes in simulations. These processes influence radiation,
evaporation, transpiration, surface temperature and albedo properties and play
an vital role in general circulation as well as mesoscale and regional models
\citep{chen2001couplingI}. Land-surface processes are crucial to the evolution
of the \gls{PBL} and the diurnal heating and cooling and topography of the earth
surface are factors that impact the \gls{PBL} \citep{burger2016aerosol}

In \gls{WRF} the \gls{LSM} allows for inputs from radiation, the microphysics
and convective schemes. Land surface processes play a major role in the
realistic simulation of the \gls{PBL}; heat and moisture fluxes over land
provides the lower boundary conditions for the vertical transport within the
\gls{PBL}. \gls{WRF} has 7 \gls{LSM} options for users, ranging from simple schemes with
only soil characteristics to advanced schemes providing hydrological, soil
and vegetation output \citep{skamarock2008description}. \gls{WRF} also provides
an urban canopy model to represent urban processes such as street canyons,
building radiation and reflection and heat equations from roof wall and road
surfaces \citep{skamarock2008description}.
See \hyperref[fig:LSM]{figure \ref{fig:LSM} \citep{chen2010improving}}.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../figures/LSM.png}
\caption[Processes represented in land surface models]{Schematic representation
of processes represented in \gls{LSM}, adapted from \cite{chen2010improving}.
\gls{LSM} process play an important role in the formation of the \gls{PBL} due
to diurnal surface heating and cooling and has to account for surface
properties including variations in heating, cooling, absorption and albedo from
different vegetations types and soils.}
\label{fig:LSM} 
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Planetary boundary layer parametrization in WRF}

The \gls{PBL} represents the first part of the troposphere in contact with
the surface. In this layer convection, momentum, heat and moisture
transport occurs from the land-surface to the atmosphere on various spatial
and temporal timescales. The \gls{PBL} could be several kilometers deep to
a few meters shallow depending on topography, albedo and moisture
availability. Interactions between the surface and the \gls{PBL} occurs on
a timescale of $=<$ 1 hour \citep{stensrud2009parameterization,
cohen2015review, burger2016aerosol}. The \gls{PBL} plays an important role
in initial formation of convection and subsequent thunderstorms from which
hail usually occurs \citep{stull2012introduction, madala2014performance}.

\gls{PBL} schemes parameterizes the vertical diffusion and vertical
sub-grid scale fluxes due to eddy transports. The \gls{PBL} derives surface
fluxes from the \gls{LSM} and determines the flux profiles within the mixed
layer and the stable layer providing temperature and moisture tendencies
within a vertical column \citep{skamarock2008description}. Because the
\gls{PBL}'s temporal scale and interactions with the \gls{LSM} and other
parameterizations is $<=$ 1 hour the diurnal cycle plays an integral part
of the \gls{PBL}'s evolution, as illustrated in \hyperref[fig:PBL]{figure
\ref{fig:PBL}}. It goes through various stable and unstable phases as the
day passes, the layer is mostly stable during evenings as the surface
begins to warm up after sunrise when heat and moisture fluxes start to
\textit{"disturb"} the \gls{PBL}. As the day goes on this energy increases
which increases the \gls{PBL} height, this layer within the \gls{PBL} is
known as the \textit{"mixed layer"}. Above the mixed layer the temperature
inversion usually occurs, that is, a increase in potential temperature with
a increase in height \citep{stensrud2009parameterization,
burger2016aerosol}.

The \gls{PBL} is more stable over South-Africa during winter when there is
a prevailing anticyclone over the subcontinent.  Simulating the processes
of the \gls{PBL} requires parametrization within \gls{NWP} models, as many
microscale phenomenons occur within this layer.  According to
\citep{burger2016aerosol} some processes are modeled explicitly but small
scale phenomenons such as turbulence is approximated within parametrization
schemes instead. 

\gls{WRF} has 13 \gls{PBL} parametrization schemes allowing the user to
select between local and non-local schemes. Non-local schemes require more
computer resources but have been shown to represent deep \gls{PBL} circulation
with more accuracy than local schemes.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../figures/pbl.png}
\caption[The PBL structure and diurnal evolution]{Simplification of the diurnal
evolution of the \gls{PBL} structure, adapted from
\citep{stull2012introduction}. The \gls{PBL} represents the first part of the
troposphere, this means the \gls{PBL} is in interaction with land-surface
processes, which in return effects heating, cooling and fluxes within the
layers. The \gls{PBL}'s temporal scale is in the order of $<1$ hour and the
interactions with the land-surface means the \gls{PBL} plays and important role
in convective formations.}
\label{fig:PBL} 
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Cumulus/convective parameterization in WRF}

Cumulus/Convective parameterizations was developed to represent convection at a
scale where it could not be resolved explicitly within models
\citep{skamarock2008description, engelbrecht2007development}, however,
interactions between the cumulus scheme and other physical processes in the
atmosphere resulted in large uncertainties withing models.
\cite{arakawa2004cumulus} argues that clouds are perhaps the most important
forcing in our atmosphere, the accurate parametrization of clouds and convection
are important to describe the various climate system
interactions. These interactions are a crucial in the accurate representation of
convection. \hyperref[fig:clouds]{Figure \ref{fig:clouds}}
\citep{arakawa2004cumulus} illustrates the different characteristics that have
to be accounted for in cumulus parameterizations, this includes and is not
limited to \gls{PBL} and microphysical processes such as lower level moisture
convergence, turbulence mixing, heat exchange and radiative properties of clouds
\citep{cretat2012uncertainties, fadnavis2014simulation,
skamarock2008description}. According to \cite{arakawa2004cumulus} shallow clouds
can be seen as part of convection process, \gls{PBL} and cumulus schemes must be
unified accordingly to achieve greater results, but this is also the source of
uncertainties within models \citep{arakawa2004cumulus}. According to
\cite{dedekind2013modelling, nikulin2012precipitation} convective
parameterization is not able to reproduce several key aspects related to
rainfall over South-Africa accurately.
	
As discussed before a relatively new field of study is the use of \gls{CPM} to
simulate events on a resolution of $\leq$4km (see
\hyperref[fig:scalesinatmopshere]{figure \ref{fig:scalesinatmopshere}}),
allowing for convective processes to be explicitly resolved by models. This
removes some of the uncertainties related to the parameterization of convection
\citep{prein2015review}. No study related to South-Africa has assessed cumulus
parameterization's relation to severe storms, and subsequently no convection
permitting studies have been done on hailstorms either. 

\gls{WRF} includes 13 cumulus parameterization options for users to choose from.
As one would expect, the combination of parameterizations play a major role in
the representation of convection, \cite{cretat2012uncertainties} stresses that
the choice of particular scheme can be counterbalanced by another, for instance
the combination of different cumulus and \gls{PBL} schemes.

{A simplified adaption of convective processes from \cite{arakawa2004cumulus} 
is shown in the above diagram. Parameterizing
convection is a major source of uncertainty within models because these features
are usually sub grid scale and have to rely on parameterizations, but it is
possible to omit the parametrization in what is known as \gls{CPM}. The benefit
of \gls{CPM} is that convection is modeled explicitly leading to greater
results, but this means the resolution of models have be set to $\leq 4km$, which
makes models computationally expensive.}

\section{An overview of macro-$\beta$ classification techniques}

Weather and climate is dependent on large scale atmospheric circulation
patterns. Understanding the relationship between these macro-$\beta$ circulation
(synoptic) patterns and local weather experienced has been an important driver
for forecasters and atmospheric researchers; this led to the development of synoptic
classification techniques\footnote{Also known as weather typing and/or synoptic typing}
to study synoptic scale links associated with surface meteorological events
\citep{jiang2012two, demuzere2011cost733, cahynova2014atmospheric, garcia2011atmospheric}. 
In the simplest of definitions synoptic clustering is the \textit{"grouping of
entities so they share common features within each group"}
\citep{huth2008classifications, sheridan2011self}. A distinction must be made
between weather classification, air mass classification and synoptic
classification. Weather classification and air mass classification are terms
commonly mixed up. Weather classification refers to a method using only near
surface variables from a single or a small number of sites. Air mass
classification uses various data sets from different levels in the troposphere
and the surface. Synoptic classification, as used in this study, 
deals with circulation patterns over large areas on one or two levels in the
atmosphere \citep{huth2008classifications}. It is also a useful tool for weather
forecasting purposes and climate model validation
\citep{philipp2014development}. The history of atmospheric circulation
classification is well documented in a report by \cite{huth2008classifications}. 

Various procedures exists to perform the synoptic classification and
\cite{huth2008classifications} divides these into three basic groups,
namely subjective (manual) mixed (hybrid) and objective (automated,
computer assisted). Although \cite{huth2008classifications} uses the term
\textit{computer assisted} the author notes the term is not adequate as a
number of subjective decisions have to be made when an objective cluster
analysis is compiled \citep{huth2008classifications, sheridan2011self}. A
generalization of the work flow used during objective cluster analysis
process is described in \hyperref[fig:clusterexample]{figure
\ref{fig:clusterexample}}, adapted from \cite{aran2011atmospheric}. Two
clustering procedures are generally used, first a principal component
analysis to reduce the data dimensions followed by the user selected
clustering method, in \cite{aran2011atmospheric} a k-means method.

Due to the high variability of hailstorms there has been limited research on
synoptic weather classifications of hail days. Attempts to understand specific
synoptic links resulting in hailstorms over the Highveld has been made by
\cite{held1979hailstorms, olivier1992impact}, but did not use specific
clustering methods. Over South-Africa \gls{SOM}s and objective synoptic typing
have been used to understand rainfall \citep{dyson2009heavy,
dyson2013atmospheric, dyson2015baseline} and fog \citep{van2013climatological}.
Recent research by \cite{garcia2011atmospheric, aran2011atmospheric,
hermida2015hailfall} examined atmospheric circulation patterns associated with
hail days in Spain. Synoptic classification can be used to examine the trends of
synoptic scale circulation patterns as in the case of \cite{kapsch2012long} who examined the
occurrence of hailstorms over Germany and also possible future trends.
\hyperref[tbl:clustersetup]{Table \ref{tbl:clustersetup}} details the indicators
used for examination of atmospheric patterns associated with hail in literature.

Recently the COST733class (hereafter COST733) software package was created
to compare, visualize and evaluate weather and circulation type
classifications \citep{philipp2014development}. The software was developed
for the \textit{"Harmonisation and Applications of Weather Types
Classifications for European Regions”} \citep{beck2010evaluation,
demuzere2011cost733}. \cite{schiemann2010circulation} evaluated the
software to resolve heavy rainfall events in the Swiss Alps and Cost733class
automatic classifications yielded superior results compared to manual
classifications, however, limited research on the application of Cost733class on
hail exists presently, in one such study by \cite{li2016hail} Cost733class was
used to examine atmospheric circulation patterns associated with hail days
over China. COST733 application dominates Europe with limited research in
other regions, see \citep{prein2016running, li2016hail} for Cost733class related
studies outside of Europe.  The objective selection of certain variables
described in literature as relevant to hail formation can greatly influence
the output of the results.  Synoptic classifications is a simplification of
complex reality and no classification method should be considered an
absolute truth \citep{jacobeit2010classifications, huth2008classifications}.

\subsection{Trend analysis of severe hail events}

Due to hailstorm's extreme spatial and temporal variability it poses a
problem for researchers when attempting to accurately analyze trends.
Several attempts have however been made to overcome this and to some degree
of success, Although most studies focus on precipitation trends, the methods
used in them can still be useful towards hail studies.
\cite{hermida2015hailfall, cao2008severe} applied the Mann-Kendall
\citep{kendall1955rank} test to analyze probable patterns related to hail
events. Similarly \cite{mohr2013recent} also applied the Mann-Kendall test
on the selected convective parameters and an criteria was setup to asses
hail insurance claims and their relationship with convective parameters
recorded on specific days. \cite{hermida2015hailfall} in comparison made
use of the following hail variables: hail days per year, annual hail
frequency and annual hail intensity to examine the trends of hail events
over France.
