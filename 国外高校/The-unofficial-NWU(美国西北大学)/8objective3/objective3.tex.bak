\chapter{Trends of hailstorms over the Highveld}
\label{sec:trends} 

The chapter analyzes the trends of thermodynamic indicators associated with
hailstorms and severe convective activity by examining data from historical
media records \citep{bureau1991history} and the \gls{IGRA} database. The
data provides insight into the reporting frequency of hail events and an
alternative perspective into the spatial distribution of events across
South-Africa. \cite{schulze1965hail, le1996modelling} \gls{HDF} map is also
reevaluated by using these data sources. Building on the numerical
simulations of the selected case studies, which focussed on simulating the
thermodynamic profile of the severe storm days, additional sounding derived
indices are evaluated from a historical context. Data from the \gls{IGRA}
is used to analyze \gls{CAPE}, \gls{CIN}, K-index, \gls{TT}, \gls{LI} and
\gls{SI} from the Irene weather station. The data is reevaluated and
analyzed similar to that of \cite{dyson2013atmospheric}. The seasonal and
long term variation of the thermodynamic indicators are evaluated by the
use of a Theil-sen slope analysis. Only the 12:00 UTC sounding was used for
the analysis; a similar method was adopted in the chapter 3 to represent
the spatial distribution of \gls{CAPE} and \gls{CIN} as convection mostly
occurs in the afternoon. The data underwent a minimum sanity check where
missing and erroneous values where removed before the analysis was started.
The chapter concludes by examining the trends and cycles of the synoptic
circulation patterns, first by investigating the long term trends of the
patterns associated with hail and then investigating their relationship to
\gls{SOI}.

\section{Media coverage of hail events and a new hailday frequency map}

Using media coverage to analyze the trends of hail events has some biases
that need to be considered, and this is discussed later on. These reports
still provide an value source of data to assess the trends and the
historical relevance of key hail events. These reports go as far back as
the late 1600's \citep{bureau1991history}. One of the first notable weather
events in South-Africa's documented weather history was a hail event in
1692 \citep{bureau1991history} affecting ships along the Cape province.
Weather events have been relatively well documented in modern times due to
their impact on society. Some sites, especially rural areas have no
official weather record and media reports serve as an alternative way to
get data from events data caused damage but may have gone unnoticed.
However the interest some weather events get may be proportionally out of
line compared to based on factors such as location and population density,
for example \cite{de2000tornadic} noted how several tornadic events in 1998
and 1999 generated above average interest in tornadoes during the time
period, the same could be said for other severe events; the media interest
in particular storm could have a influence on how it is reported and
consequently perceived by the public. It should also be noted that the
small spatial extend of severe events could that many events occur in
unpopulated areas and go unreported.  \cite{punge2016hail} also supported
this notion as he states there is an higher chance of storms begin reported
during the growing season in agricultural regions.  With these
uncertainties and biases in mind,
\hyperref[fig:hailinmedia_100years]{figure \ref{fig:hailinmedia_100years}}
shows the reporting frequency for hail events over the last century. Some
subjectivity was used to classify severe and non serve events, for an event
to be classified as severe some loss of life (human or livestock) occurred,
or damage to property was emphasized in the report.  In
\hyperref[fig:hailinmedia_100years]{Figure \ref{fig:hailinmedia_100years}}
an increase in reported hail events from the 1980's onwards is observed,
however, there seems to be a drop in reported severe hailstorms from 2000 -
2015. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{hail-reports-tseries.png}
\caption[Severe hail reports as seen in media over the last 100 years]{The 
diagram represents media reports on hail over the last 100 years.  The data
is mostly from \cite{bureau1991history}, while additional data was gathered
from media reports in popular newspapers. This was used as sources to to
update \cite{bureau1991history} reports. As seen, the number of reports has steadily
increased from 1900's, this could mainly be due to the fact that the extend
of media coverage has increased and more news outlets are in existence,
another factor is the increase in weather monitoring sites, population
density and industries affected by hail storms.}
\label{fig:hailinmedia_100years}
\end{figure}

\hyperref[fig:hailinmedia_annual]{Figure \ref{fig:hailinmedia_annual}}
represents the annual distribution of hail reports over the whole
South-Africa. The diagram shows a similar trend as the seasonal cycle of
hail, thunderstorm and severe rainfall events associated with summer
convection. The seasonal cycle is discussed again later as related to the
thermodynamic profile of the atmosphere.  

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{hail-reports-annual.png}
\caption[Annual distribution of hail reports as seen in media]{The annual
distribution of hail media reports and is in general agreement with the
annual distribution of hail over South-Africa, we can see that October and
November have a proportionally higher reporting instances.}
\label{fig:hailinmedia_annual}
\end{figure}

To represent the spatial distribution of the media reports seen in
\hyperref[fig:hailinmedia_annual]{figure \ref{fig:hailinmedia_annual}} the
data is plotted spatially over South-Africa in
\hyperref[fig:hailreportinmedia]{figure \ref{fig:hailreportinmedia}}.  The
\hyperref[fig:hailreportinmedia]{figure} illustrates the high prevalence of
hail reports in populated places, and this could be expected.  Densely
populated places will have an higher chance of hail being reported compared
to rural or unpopulated areas. Around the Drakensburg there is also high
frequency of hail events, the area is mostly rural with some midsize
towns. In \cite{schulze1965hail, le1996modelling} \gls{HDF} map
it is clear that this area also has a high \gls{HDF}. Several reports over the
Western Cape are visible and these events usually occur in the mountainous
regions in the form of soft hail or ice \citep{tyson2000atmosphere}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{hailreportinmedia.png}
\caption[Spatial distribution of severe hail reports in media]{The spatial
distribution of severe hail events according to media reports correlates
with the distribution of hail over South-Africa as described by
\cite{schulze1965hail, le1996modelling, cecil2012toward}. The number of
severe hail reports are higher over Gauteng, mainly due to the area's high
population and infrastructure density}
\label{fig:hailreportinmedia}
\end{figure}

A alternative \gls{HDF} is illustrated in
\hyperref[fig:newhdfmap]{figure \ref{fig:newhdfmap}} by the combination of
media and historical weather data for South-Africa. The new \gls{HDF} map
shows similar a similar distribution of hail events to that of
\cite{schulze1965hail, le1996modelling, cecil2012toward}. The map does not
interpolate the data spatially but instead shows the \gls{HDF} as reported at an
specific site. The figure illustrates that the Highveld area consisting of parts
of Mpumalanga, Free-State, Gauteng and North-West shows a high density of hail
events. Parts of the Northern Eastern-Cape around Lesotho also have a high
density of events compared with the Southern parts of the province. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{hdf_annual.png}
\caption[A new hailday frequency map]{A new hail day frequency map created from
\cite{bureau1986climate} data and \cite{bureau1991history} reports. The HDF
map is in agreement with that of \cite{schulze1965hail, le1996modelling,
cecil2012toward}, a high HDF is observed around the Lesotho highlands, the
Highveld region as a whole has a HDF between 2 - 4, while Johannesburg
metropolitan area has a HDF between 4 - 6 per year. As noted by
\cite{tyson2000atmosphere} the mountains around the Western Cape region
receives hail too, which is evident in the above figure,but this is usually
in the form of soft hail and ice rain.} 
\label{fig:newhdfmap}
\end{figure}

Some limitations of using the above dataset has already been mentioned.
Arguments can be made that media reports are biased towards reporting
storms that resulted in extreme damage and as such many storms that are
deemed insignificant from a economic or social perspective may never to be
heard of again in the media. However, we can see that the annual reports of
hail is generally in agreement with the known seasonal distribution of
severe weather and hail events occurring form early October to late
February. Winter hail events could be disproportionally reported because of
the rare nature of these events. The biases in the media is well
understood, however the data can be useful to understand the perception and
impact of hail events in certain areas. 

\section{Overview of thermodynamic indices and the seasonal and long term
trends}

Chapter 3 provided insight into the spatio-temporal extend of variables
associated with severe hail storms. In the chapter five case studies where
simulated on \gls{CPM} scale. These cases are not representative of all
hailstorms over the Highveld or Gauteng, but was used to evaluate the
thermodynamic properties of severe hailstorms on the small meso-$\gamma$
scale. The results shows the prominence of some thermodynamic variables in
the simulations of severe events. \gls{CAPE}, \gls{CIN} showed a inverse
correlation while the \gls{SI} values associated with severe events were
within the threshold of values associated with thunderstorms in all the
cases. In the following section these thermodynamic variables are evaluated
to examine seasonality and the long term trends, the \gls{IGRA} radiosonde
dataset was used in this section as the data goes back to 1975 and
undergoes a quality control procedure.

The \gls{IGRA} \citep{durre2006overview} database contains radiosonde data
from weather stations around the world. The Irene dataset is included in
this database and was used to analyze the trend of the thermodynamic
indicators associated with severe events. Radiosonde data is prone to
failures, however and within the scope of this study the data underwent a
minimum sanity check as the \gls{IGRA} already has a quality control
procedure \citep{durre2006overview}. \cite{dyson2013atmospheric} advises
against the use of the \gls{IGRA} database as data for some periods is
missing and erroneous dew point are could impact soundings on convective
days. A inspection on the database did show missing data otherwise the data
was relatively complete. After an extra sanity check for missing or
erroneous values the soundings were used for analysis.  Each of the indices
derived from the sounding and the associated \textit{value} with severe
weather events is briefly discussed below.  \cite{dyson2013atmospheric}
emphasizes that thermodynamic variables and values associated convection
may differ across geographic locations. The values discussed serve as
baseline and is not specific to the Highveld. The values associated with
severe events are briefly discussed here again.

\paragraph{CAPE and CIN}
\gls{CAPE} (see equation \hyperref[eq:cape]{\ref{eq:cape}}) is well known
indicator associated with severe storms. The variable serves as a
indication of a lifting parcels buoyancy. \gls{CAPE} values $\geq 1000$
J/kg are associated with a high possibility of severe weather events
occurring. In the case studies from chapter 3 high \gls{CAPE} was observed
spatially and temporally. The simulations also indicated that \gls{CIN}
(see equation \hyperref[eq:cin]{\ref{eq:cin}}) has an inverse correlation
with \gls{CAPE}. This is expected as \gls{CIN} is also known as negative
\gls{CAPE}. \gls{CIN} refers to the negative energy a parcel has to
overcome in order to break through the CAP and lift to its \gls{EL}.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption[CAPE and CIN values associated with convective events]{CAPE and CIN

\begin{tabular}{ll|ll}
\hline
\multicolumn{2}{c|}{CAPE (J/kg)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{CIN (J/kg)} \\ \hline
Weak instability & 0 - 1000 & $\leq -15$ & Minor convection  (early formation) \\
Moderate instability & $\geq 1000$ \& $\leq 2500$ & $\geq - 15$ \& $\leq - 50$ & Possible singlecell storms \\
Strong instability & $\geq 2500$ \& $\leq 4000$ & $\geq - 50$ \& $\leq - 200$ & Possible multicell storms \\
Extreme instability & $\geq 4000$ & $\geq - 200$ & No convection (stability to high) \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{The Showalter and lifted index}

The \gls{SI} provides an indication of the instability in the atmosphere
\citep{showalter1953stability}, see \hyperref[eq:si_i]{equation
\ref{eq:si_i}} \footnote{According to \cite{tyson2000atmosphere} the
\gls{SI} has been configured for use over South-Africa by the
\gls{SAWS}, this method is however not used and the \gls{IGRA}
derived \gls{SI} is used in its original form}. Table
\hyperref[tbl:si_index_1]{\ref{tbl:si_index_1}} indicates the values of the
indices and the associated convective event.  \cite{dyson2013atmospheric}
found that the lowest average \gls{SI} value occurs during December over
the Highveld (-2$\degree$C). The \gls{LI} \citep{galway1956lifted} is
similar to the above mentioned \gls{SI}. According to
\cite{groenemeijer2007sounding} the \gls{LI} shows considerable skill to
forecast severe convective events associated with hail. The index
represents a parcel as it is lifted from the surface to the \gls{LCL}
whereas (\gls{SI} calculates a parcel lifting from 850 hPa). Because of
this similarity between \gls{SI} and \gls{LI}
\hyperref[tbl:si_index_1]{table \ref{tbl:si_index_1}} similar thresholds
exist.

\begin{table}[H]

\hline
Showalter Index \\ \hline
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Weak instability \& little to no rain} & $\geq 0$ \\
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Moderate instability \& thunderstorm activity} & 0 to - 3 \\
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Strong instability \& severe thunderstorm activity} & $\leq - 3$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{The K-Index}

The K-index \citep{george2014weather} is another thermodynamic derived product
used to evaluate instability in the atmosphere. The index (see
\hyperref[eq:ki]{equation \ref{eq:ki}}), is based on the vertical temperature
gradient between 850hPa and 500hPa. Table
\hyperref[tbl:k_index]{\ref{tbl:k_index}} indicates the values of the indices
and the associated level of instability. According to
\cite{dyson2013atmospheric} the \gls{KI} index over South-Africa is $\geq
30\degree$C during the South-African thunderstorm season. January has the
highest average \gls{KI} at $37\degree$C, well above the threshold used to
evaluate the possibility of thunderstorm occurrences. The \gls{KI} may also be prone to
erroneous values as dry air at 700 hPa could falsely indicate instability.

\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Moderate instability} & 20 - 30 \\
\multicolumn{1}{l|}{Strong instability} & $\geq 30$ \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{The total totals index}
The \gls{TT}, is a sum of the \gls{VT} and \gls{CT}, see
\hyperref[eq:TTI]{equation \ref{eq:TTI}}. Along with providing a measure of
instability the indicator can also provide an estimate of storm strength
\citep{miller1972notes}. \hyperref[tbl:tt_index]{Table
\ref{tbl:tt_index}} shows the \gls{TT} values and the associated
convection in the atmosphere. \cite{dyson2013atmospheric} found that
the \gls{TT} values are the highest in December. The variation
between the \gls{TT} values in October, November, December and January
differs minimally. In \cite{de2000tornadic} study of the 15 November
1998 and 18 January 1999 tornadic events only \gls{TT} met the threshold
for the indication of a possible severe event on both occasions.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Seasonal trends of thermodynamic indicators}

The \gls{IGRA} dataset for the Irene weather station was used to analyze
the trends of thermodynamic indicators for a period of 45 years. Each
indicator was analyzed for season and long term trends. The section is
similar to \cite{dyson2013atmospheric} analysis of heavy rainfall events
using sounding derived indicators, also heavily influenced by summer
convection. The exception is that \cite{dyson2013atmospheric} used
radiosonde data from the \gls{UWYO} database. The \gls{IGRA} database is
instead used here A Theil-sen slope analysis is used to determine the
trends of the selected parameters along with the 95\% confidence interval
of the slopes. In the analysis seasons is defined as summer (December,
January \& February), autumn (March, April \& May), winter (June, July \&
August) and finally spring (September, October \& November).

\hyperref[fig:cape_ts_m]{Figure \ref{fig:cape_ts_m}} shows a clear
indication of the seasonal variation observed in \gls{CAPE}. Spring and
summer months are associated with the highest average \gls{CAPE} values,
with summer averages slightly over 1000 $j/kg$. This is ideal for the
formation of convective storms. The high values is expected as the
circulation over South-Africa during summer is associated warm tropical
circulation, which is highly unstable and increases the amount of buoyant
energy in the atmosphere. There is a significant upward trend in the
buoyant energy available in the atmosphere over the last 40 + years,
particularly in the spring and summer months. The Thiel-Sen slope analysis
indicates a significant trend of 0.59 and 0.46 for the spring and summer
months respectively. No significant trend is observed in the autumn and
winter months and \gls{CAPE} values seem to be relatively stable. These
observations supports \cite{dyson2013atmospheric} findings that \gls{CAPE}
values peak in December and January. The positive seasonal trend that is
observed in the \gls{CAPE} values indicate that the atmosphere is becoming
increasingly favorable for the formation of severe events associated with
convection. 

The inverse correlation between \gls{CIN} and \gls{CAPE} has been discussed
previously in chapter 2. In \hyperref[fig:cin_ts_m]{Figure
\ref{fig:cin_ts_m}} we see that the seasonal trend is less pronounced then
that of \gls{CAPE}. The lowest values of \gls{CIN} is observed during the
summer months from November to February, with only a marginal difference
between the seasons. The fine balance between \gls{CIN} and \gls{CAPE} is
emphasized again, if the \gls{CIN} is to low severe storms will not appear
and only cumulus clouds will form while high \gls{CIN} can completely
prevent storm formation. According to \cite{grieser2012convection} values
of $-15 \lessgtr -200$ is favorable for convective activity. The values
remain stable throughout the year and no significant difference is observed
between the seasons.

\end{figure}

The \gls{KI}, based on the vertical temperature gradient between 850hPa and
500hPa, has a well defined seasonal variation, see
\hyperref[fig:ki_ts_m]{figure \ref{fig:ki_ts_m}}. The highest \gls{KI}
values are observed in the summer months and there is also a observed
positive trend in this value indicating a increasingly convective favoring
atmosphere over during summer months. A positive trend is also observed
during spring months, although not significant. Autumn and winter months
show no significant positive trend, we can see however that the winter
months show a trend towards a more stable atmosphere with a slight
decreasing trend. This is similar to that observed by
\cite{dyson2013atmospheric}.

\caption[The seasonal distribution of the K-Index]{The
seasonal distribution of the K-Index} 
\label{fig:ki_ts_m}
\end{figure}

The \gls{SI} was well represented in each of the case studies simulated in
chapter 3. In \hyperref[fig:si_ts_m]{figure \ref{fig:si_ts_m}} the \gls{SI}
shows a well defined seasonal variation. The summer months have a average
of $-3\degree C$ indicating an unstable atmosphere favoring convection,
however, this is only observed in the summer months. In autumn, winter and
spring all \gls{SI} values are slightly positive (stable atmosphere). The
\gls{SI} values also show no significant trend towards a convective
favoring atmosphere in any of the seasons. The \gls{LI}, \hyperref[fig:li_ts_m]{figure
\ref{fig:li_ts_m}}, shows a similar seasonal variation to the \gls{SI},
however there is a significant trend seen in summer, spring and autumn
months towards a more unstable atmosphere. Winter \gls{LI} values show no
significant trend that indicating that the atmosphere has remains
relatively stable during this season based.

\label{fig:li_ts_m}
\end{figure}

The \gls{TT} values observed at the Irene weather station show a clear
seasonal variation, similar to the indicators already discussed. The
\gls{TT} value is useful in that it provides a measure of possible storm
intensity as well as instability \citep{grieser2012convection}. In \hyperref[fig:tti_ts_m]{figure
\ref{fig:tti_ts_m}} no significant trend is observed in the \gls{TT}
values. The seasonal variation between spring and summer is minimal, while
the winter conditions is stable, as expected. According to
\cite{dyson2013atmospheric} summer highs are in the order of $\pm 53\degree$C,
however \hyperref[fig:tti_ts_m]{Figure \ref{fig:tti_ts_m}} indicates marginally lower
values then found by \cite{dyson2013atmospheric}. 

\begin{figure}[!htb]

\end{figure}

In this section the seasonal trends and variations of selected
sounding derived variables were evaluated. Data was used from the
\gls{IGRA} database that undergoes a quality control procedure before
public release. The Thiel-sen slope analysis was used to evaluate the
seasonal trends of the selected indicators from 1975 to 2016. The Thiel-Sen
analysis is robust and depends on the median slope of the data, this means
that outliers influence the data less. Furthermore, only the 12:00 UTC
sounding was extracted from the dataset as convective storms mostly occur
within the early to later afternoon. Six thermodynamic variables were
analyzed, this included \gls{CAPE}, \gls{CIN}, \gls{KI}, \gls{SI}, \gls{LI}
and \gls{TT}. Three indicators showed a significant trend towards an
convective a favoring atmosphere, this was \gls{CAPE}, \gls{KI} and \gls{LI}.
\gls{CAPE} was also used in the previous two chapters, first as a variable
to evaluate the meso-$\gamma$ scale environment associated with severe
weather events and then as a variable to drive the cluster analysis.
A significant increase in \gls{CAPE} is observed during spring and summer
months while winter and autumn remain stable. The \gls{KI} was only showed
a significant trend during summer months. The last indicator that
showed a significant trend was the \gls{LI} where spring, summer and autumn
had a significant trend towards a more unstable atmosphere. \gls{CIN} also
showed a significant trend positive trend, however, the indicator is
difficult to evaluate as there is a balance between the stable layer
represented by \gls{CIN} and buoyancy represented by \gls{CAPE}. If
\gls{CIN} values are to low $\leq -15$ only minor convection will occur and
storms could form to early to result in significant events, however, high
\gls{CIN}, $\geq -200$ could prevent lifting and convection might not occur
either. If \gls{CIN} is evaluated along with the increasing \gls{CAPE}
observed during spring and summer, it could be that the positive \gls{CIN}
trend observed shows a atmosphere where lifting is increasingly favoured.
The \gls{SI} and \gls{TT} show no significant trend in the seasonal
analysis.

\subsection{Long term thermodynamic trends of thermodynamic indicators}

Over South-Africa scientists have stated that climate change could result
in a increase in extreme events associated with heavy rainfall, flooding
and possibly more severe hailstorms. The $4\degree$C increase projected
would have an strong effect on convective nature of the atmosphere
\citep{engelbrecht2013high, piketh2014climate}. More heat allows the
atmosphere to hold more moisture and also increases the amount of
convective energy. In the following section the long term trend of
\gls{CAPE}, \gls{CIN}, \gls{KI}, \gls{SI}, \gls{LI} and \gls{TT} is
evaluated from the \gls{IGRA} dataset. As with the seasonal analysis a
Thiel-Sen slope analysis is used as the method is robust and insensitive to
outliers. Only the 12:00 UTC was used in the analysis as convection is most
likely to occur in the afternoon and later afternoon. 

\hyperref[fig:cape_longterm]{Figure \ref{fig:cape_longterm}} indicates that \gls{CAPE}
has increased significantly over the last three decades (0.36). The
increased \gls{CAPE} supports the climate change predictions of
\citep{engelbrecht2013high, piketh2014climate} as the variable is a
function of the energy in the atmosphere, which effects the convection type
and intensity. When the seasonal analysis is considered we can see that
most of the increased \gls{CAPE} occurs within the spring and summer
months. This would mean that although there is an overall trend towards a
convective favoring atmosphere most an increase in convective storms is
expected to be mostly in these seasons while winter and autumn remain
stable. 

\gls{CIN} importance has been throughout discussed in the previous
sections. The variable plays a fine balancing act in the stability of the
atmosphere. Too high stability would prevent unstable lifting of air, while
too little stability would result in convection triggering to early and
possibly no storms. The long term trends from the \gls{IGRA} dataset
indicate that \gls{CIN} is significantly decreasing (-0.46)
(\hyperref[fig:cin_longterm]{figure \ref{fig:cin_longterm}}). The decreasing
\gls{CIN} value is still within the thunderstorm threshold as described by
\cite{grieser2012convection}. However the \gls{CIN} value should be
evaluated concurrent to \gls{CAPE}. The increasing \gls{CAPE} value along
with the observed \gls{CIN} value could indicate that the conditions for
thunderstorm formation is becoming more favorable, the \gls{CIN} is not
increasing to a level where convection is completely halted neither do we
observe low \gls{CIN} where convection is triggered to early.

\end{figure}

The \gls{SI} showed skill in the simulations discussed in chapter 2, in all
five case studies the \gls{SI} was simulated within thunderstorm
thresholds. \hyperref[fig:si_longterm]{Figure \ref{fig:si_longterm}}
indicates that the long value of the \gls{SI} shows a slightly decreasing
trend (lower \gls{SI} values is associated with severe weather) over the
last three decades. This decreasing \gls{SI} supports the \gls{CAPE}
observations that an increasingly unstable atmosphere is ever more present
over Guateng.  However, the trend is marginal and by referring back to the
seasonal variation of the \gls{SI} index this can also be seen. The slight
decreasing value is however important to observe and when the rare
spatio-temporal nature of severe events is taken into account this trend is
significant. The \gls{LI} is similar to the \gls{SI}, however a stronger
trend towards convective favoring atmosphere is observed with a
Theil-Sen slope of -2.61 (\hyperref[fig:li_longterm]{figure
\ref{fig:li_longterm}}).

\end{figure}

The \gls{KI} (\hyperref[fig:ki_longterm]{figure \ref{fig:ki_longterm}})
also indicates a marginal increase towards a slightly more convective
favoring atmosphere, the Thiel-Sen slope analysis indicates that a positive
trend of 0.18 over the last three decades. The seasonal analysis of the
\gls{KI} shows that this increase is mostly observe in spring and summer
months, similar to \gls{CAPE}, \gls{SI} and \gls{LI} variables.

The \gls{TT} does not show the same significant trend towards an convective
favoring atmosphere, no significant trend is observed in the \gls{TT}
Thiel-Sen analysis. The seasonal analysis of the \gls{TT} shows the is in
agreement, although a slight increase in the seasonal analysis is observed,
it is insignificant. The long term analysis indicates a value of 0.01
increase, also not significant.

\end{figure}

The section investigated the long term trends of thermodynamic indicators
associated with severe events usually occurring along with convective
storms. The Thiel-Sen slope analysis was used to investigate the trends and
was chosen due to the robustness and the how the method handles outlier
values. Six indicators where selected, this was \gls{CAPE}, \gls{CIN},
\gls{SI}, \gls{LI}, \gls{KI} and \gls{TT}. Each of the chosen variables are
popular derivatives of sounding data used to evaluate the possibly of
severe storm occurrences, the data was gathered from the \gls{IGRA}
database and starting in 1975 until early 2017. The long term trend
analysis indicated that the atmosphere is increasingly becoming favorable for
convective storms. \gls{CAPE} shows the most significant increase with a
Thiel-Sen value of 0.36. \gls{CAPE} is significant in the formation of
severe events and the increase indicates a environment where convection
is becoming more prominent. The seasonal analysis, discussed in the
previous section, shows that this increase is mainly in the spring and
summer months while winter months have remained relatively stable over the
observation period. \gls{CIN} shows a marginal decrease, however, the value
is still within the thresholds for thunderstorm formation and when analyzed
concurrently with \gls{CAPE} we can see a atmosphere increasingly suitable
for convective activity. The next three variables analyzed all showed the
same trend towards a marginally more unstable atmosphere. The \gls{SI} and
\gls{LI} again indicated a trend towards a convective favoring environment.
The \gls{LI} value showed a significant trend towards this, while the
\gls{SI} marginally less so. As with \gls{CAPE} this increase is mainly
observed in the spring and summer months. The last index, the \gls{TT} did
not indicate a significant increase or decrease, this was also observed in
the seasonal observations.


\section{The trends and cycles of synoptic patterns associated with hail
events}

In the previous section the trends of specific thermodynamic indicators
were evaluated for a 40 year time span, the results indicated that the
atmosphere is becoming more favorable for the development of convective
storms, especially in the summer months. Moving on towards the larger scale
synoptic circulation. The following section investigates the trends and
cycles of the macro-$\beta$ scale environment. Data from chapter 4 is used
in this analysis, here it was observed that hail events occur within
synoptic patterns that are most prominent in spring and summer months,
characterised by a low pressure system over the interior of South-Africa
and a well defined area of \gls{CAPE} over a large part of the country.
As in the previous trend analysis a Thiel-Sen slope analysis is used to
evaluate the long term occurrence of hail related synoptic environments,
while the next analysis investigates the correlation between the synoptic
environments and the \gls{SOI}.

\subsection{Long term trends of synoptic patterns associated with
hail}

In chapter 4 an analysis of the macro-$\beta$ scale circulation patterns
associated with hail events was conducted, three patterns showed a high
frequency of occurrence during the hail season and also a high number of
reported events, namely cluster 11, 7 and 3 (see figure
\ref{fig:cluster_reports}). The following analysis used the data from the
above results, each cluster's monthly occurrence was counted for the 35
year time period and then a Thiel-Sen slope analysis was applied. The
analysis was only conducted on cluster 11, 7 and 3 respectively as these
cluster where most prominent during the known hail season and also had more
reported events occurring in them.

Most severe hail events seen in media reports occurred within cluster 11
while the annual distribution of the cluster also falls within the
\textit{traditional} November, December, January and February hail season 
(see figure \ref{fig:cluster_reports}, \ref{fig:cluster_freq}). The
circulation in this cluster is similar to the easterly wave described by
\cite{tyson2000atmosphere}. A low pressure system (\gls{TTT}) originating from the
tropics is visible over the central, northern-western parts of the country, the
\gls{TTT} brings warm, moist air from the \gls{ITCZ} and leeds to
characteristic summer convective events. \gls{CAPE} observed in this cluster is evenly
distributed across the country, it appears as if no exceptionally high
\gls{CAPE} is associated with the cluster, due to the local, small scale nature of severe
events this can be expected. In \hyperref[fig:cluster11_thiel]{figure
\ref{fig:cluster11_thiel}} the long term trend and occurrence of cluster 11
is examined. The results yielded no statistically significant indication of
an increase of days related to this circulation over the 35 year period.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{cluster_11_thiel.png}
\caption[The long term trend of hail related synoptic
patterns, cluster 11]{Cluster 11 had the most related hail media reports.
The cluster showed a characteristic Summer peak that is generally
associated with hail events as seen in previous literature, however, the
Thiel-sen analysis did not indicate any increase in
days associated with this pattern being observed over South-Africa.}
\label{fig:cluster11_thiel}
\end{figure}

Similar to cluster 11, cluster 7 is characterised by \gls{TTT} extending
over the central, north-western interior bring about warm moist air from
the \gls{ITCZ}. Cluster 7 annual cycle shows a more evenly distributed
pattern with some occurrences in autumn and winter months, however the
peaks are still observed during the hail season. The counted cluster
occurrence per month and the subsequent Thiel-sen analysis again indicated
no significant trend towards more hail favouring days occurring over the
time period, see (\hyperref[fig:cluster_7_thiel]{figure
\ref{fig:cluster_7_thiel}})

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{cluster_7_thiel.png}
\caption[The long term trend of hail related synoptic
patterns, cluster 7]{The Thiel-Sen analysis of days associated with cluster
7's synoptic pattern associated with hail events did not show a increase in
prevalence over the last 35 years}
\label{fig:cluster7_thiel}
\end{figure}

In cluster 3 a pattern emerges which is only observed during the
spring/summer months associated with hail events (see
\hyperref[fig:cluster_freq]{figure \ref{fig:cluster_freq}}). Absent from
cluster 3 is the prominent \gls{TTT} extending over the interior of the
country, however, the cluster is characterised by high \gls{CAPE} over the
eastern seaboard. The resulting synoptic pattern is similar to a easterly
low as described by \cite{tyson2000atmosphere}, where the Indian ocean
high extends over the eastern coast and rainfall originates from the
northerly direction. The synoptic pattern is characteristic of summer
months, showing the highest occurrence in November - January. as seen in 
\hyperref[fig:cluster_3_thiel]{figure \ref{fig:cluster_3_thiel}} the Thiel-sen
analysis again showed no significant trend towards a increase in the
observed pattern.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{cluster_3_thiel.png}
\caption[The long term trend of hail related synoptic
patterns, cluster 3]{The long term trend of cluster 3 hail related synoptic
pattern showed no significant increase in days associated with this type
of large scale circulation}
\label{fig:cluster_3_thiel}
\end{figure}

The Thiel-sen was used in the section to evaluate the trends of hail
related synoptic days, because of the convective nature of hail events the
results also have a correlation to severe thunderstorms and rainfall days.
In chapter 4 three characteristic clusters, indicative of synoptic days,
stood out. These clusters where counted as the occurred per month over a
time period  of 35 years. As with the analysis of the thermodynamic
indicators the Thiel-sen slope analysis was applied on the data. The
results indicate that none of the three hail related clusters showed a
significant increase in frequency. The spatio-temporal nature of convective
do impact the analysis on a synoptic scale, however, the key synoptic
features observed do provide a general idea of the dominant circulation
patterns associated with these events. The results mentioned here are in
agreement with observations related to the synoptic patterns of South-Africa by
\cite{tyson2000atmosphere,taljaard1981upper,taljaard1986change,dyson2013atmospheric}.

\subsection{The relationship between hail related synoptic patterns and the
SOI}

Literature regarding the relationship between \gls{ENSO} and severe events
over South-Africa is rare. This was however addressed in an recent
investigation by \cite{blamey2016climatology}, the authors looked at
potential days favoring severe events which was in turn based on \gls{CAPE}
and 0 - 6km bulk shear. Days identified to be favoring severe events showed
no relationship according to \gls{ENSO} \cite{blamey2016climatology}.  In
this study the correlation is investigated for the occurrence of synoptic
patterns identified in chapter 4. The specific synoptic patterns are also
similar to the synoptic patterns identified by
\cite{tyson2000atmosphere,taljaard1981upper,taljaard1986change,dyson2013atmospheric}
related to summer rainfall and convective activities.

\section{A discussion on the temporal variation of hail indicators} 

In the section severe hailstorms were investigated by using data sources
that included media reports and radiosonde data. In the first part the
media reports was analyzed from the \cite{bureau1991history} and by
investigating media reports from regional and local media outlets. The
media reports were examined for long term and seasonal distribution. The
long term distribution indicated that there is an increase in hail reports
as seen in print media (\hyperref[fig:hailinmedia_100years]{figure
\ref{fig:hailinmedia_100years}}). \hyperref[fig:hailinmedia_annual]{Figure
\ref{fig:hailinmedia_annual}} indicates the annual distribution of hail
reports as seen in the media. The reporting distribution follows the same
pattern as the annual hail frequency observed where events are most
frequently reported in the spring and summer months.  It should be noted
that there is various factors affecting this. The increase in the
population of Gauteng and the subsequent increase in print media outlets
made it possible to report more storms. The population distribution also
impacts the reporting of hailstorms, as populated cities expand, there is
an higher chance of incidence reports. Following this a temporal analysis
of hail reports was conducted. A map representing the spatial distribution
of media reports were created to for the whole of South-Africa
(\hyperref[fig:hailreportinmedia]{figure \ref{fig:hailreportinmedia}})
indicating a high concentration of reports in the Guateng area. Based on
the media reports a \gls{HDF} map (\hyperref[fig:newhdfmap]{figure
\ref{fig:newhdfmap}}) was constructed similar to that of
\cite{schulze1965hail, le1996modelling}. The new map indices an high HDF in
over the Lesotho highlands and Guateng, as observed in previous studies
mentioned. 

Data from \gls{IGRA} show a clear seasonal trend between the selected
thermodynamic indicators. In all cases the thermodynamic variables
associated with convection is most prominent during November, December and
January. Apart from the \gls{TT} index, all the sounding derived variables
indicated a trend towards conditions favoring convective environment. The
effects of severe events will especially be felt by those in impoverished
areas where infrastructure and emergency services are least prepared to
handle events such as severe hailstorms and flash flooding, associated with
convective weather, which according to data could become a more frequent
occurrence.

The last part of the study investigated the synoptic patterns associated
with hail events as examined in chapter 4. Here the long term trends of
hail related synoptic circulation was investigated by using a Thiel-sen
analysis. The second part of the section investigated the relationship
between the synoptic patterns and \gls{ENSO} and the \gls{SOI}. The results
indicated that there was no significant increase in synoptic patterns
associated with hail events, although the synoptic patterns themself were
well defined similar to other research conducted. The link with
\gls{ENSO}/\gls{SOI} also showed no statistical correlation. The difference
in the results between the small scale trends and the synoptic scale trends
is most likely due to the small/local nature of convective events, not
always captured accurately by large scale synoptic analysis.
