\chapter{Abstract}

Social navigation usage on the Social Web were studied by conducting content
analyzes to see how prevalent such navigation is now compared to the Web's
earlier years.
The common characteristic of the types of social navigation we found
in these sites were the reliance on peers for the information used in the
navigation process. We therefore built on existing definitions of social
navigation an provided our own definition which emphasized the essentialness
of peers in the web site one is navigating in.

We found activity streams\dash{}chronological listings of what
all the individuals one is particularly interested in have recently been
doing on a web site\dash{}to be an interesting and seemingly useful technique
of social navigation. A prototype of activity streams were built on top of the
\urort{} web site to test the usefulness of such a social
navigation technique in a real world two-group experiment with a pre-post
setup. The experiment results were somewhat inconclusive, partly
because of high non-accomplishment rates and some ambiguous results.
The high non-accomplishment rates seemed to have a strong connection to the
technical prototype plattform we used as participants had a hard time trying
to install the necessary software.
