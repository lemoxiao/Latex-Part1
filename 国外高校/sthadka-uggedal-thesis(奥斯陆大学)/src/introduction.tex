\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:introduction}

The web has come a long way since its inception when it functioned as a
global interconnected system for document sharing amongst researchers
\citep[\p{82}]{bernerslee92}. We've
seen the coming of an increasingly more social web as

It has been argued that web citizens'
familiarity with blogging laid the groundwork for the explosion we are seeing
in user participation in web communities
\citedouble{\p{20}}{weiss05}{\para{2.2}}{beer07}.

At the same time advances in hardware and web development tools have made it
easier and cheaper to create new web sites. We're now seeing an
abundance of new offerings in this field.
It has been argued that many of the concepts this modern web brings are
evolutionary instead of revolutionary \citep[\p{45}]{yakovlev07}.
\citet[\p{17}]{treese06} also witnesses a continuous evolution, but with
exploratory innovations as he notes that most technological changes are
incremental.%

      the whole field has changed significantly}

What we're experiencing
today with the World Wide Web and social/collaborative software systems was
envisioned several decades ago by \citet{licklider68} and \citet{bush45}.

During the initial studies of our research we frequented
many of these modern web sites. Our impression is that
this area of the web infamously coined \term{Web 2.0}\dash{}an
increment in version opposed to the age when the Web was in its
infancy\dash{}is bringing interesting innovations. While they might not be
groundbreaking, we justify a closer look at them in this thesis.

\section{Focus}

This thesis have a focus on navigational problems and only those
which are of a social type.%
\sidenote[-1]{%
  Take a look at \sectionref{social.navigation.social.navigation}
  to learn more about navigational systems with social characteristics.
}
Navigation in context of computer systems is
essentially a metaphor based on how people find their way in the physical
world. So just as a compass and map can be crucial in your ability to find a
cabin deep in the woods during a hike\dash{}reliable and efficient
navigational systems on the web is of uttermost importance when you're trying
to locate a certain electronic object containing valuable information.

In addition to only focusing on \term{social navigation} we're only concerned
which such types of navigation on the Web.
On the Web we're using hyperlinks \citep[\p{90}]{nelson65} to provide users
with navigational choices. We're only focusing on the use of such hyperlinks
within web browsers and not navigation support in auxiliary tools as email
clients, instant messaging clients, and so on. Our focus is further refined by
targeting our research  only on what happens inside various web pages. This
means that other navigation forms supported by the browser itself or third
party extensions or plugins is outside of our scope, as detailed in
\sectionref{social.navigation.navigation.navigation.on.the.web}.

While we're aware that search is an important part of peoples every day
navigational behavior we've introduced additional confinements and decided to
only concentrate on browsing behavior (see
\sectionref{social.navigation.navigation.navigation.on.the.web} for details).

When studying various web pages it became apparent that some use of
social navigation mechanisms implies pretty large privacy concerns. By mining
users' previous actions specific user profiles can be generated. One can then
represent very sensitive characteristics of individuals such as sexual
orientation, political status, and religious beliefs.
We feel this subject area of social navigation in relation to privacy warrants
a master thesis on its own. Discussion of privacy concerns have therefore
been excluded from our research so that we can look more closely at the
navigational characteristics of social navigation.

\section{Motivation}

\sidetable[Social Navigation in Academia]{%
           Social navigation in academia, by content.
           When collecting these statistics we encountered similar articles
           by the same authors discussing the same problems and systems. In
           such circumstances the collection of two or more similar articles
           was counted as one.
           \label{table:social.navigation.academia}}{%
  \begin{tabular}{lr}

  \end{tabular}
}

Social navigation are as we'll see in
\sectionref{social.navigation.social.navigation}
a well defined term within the academic community.
During our literature review we collected to the best of our abilities all
academic articles where social navigation was discussed. Our approach was to
use keyword search and citation search in the databases listed in
\tablepageref{literature.databases}.%
\sidenote[7]{
  For more about our literature collection method, see
  \sectionref{literature.search}.
}
\tableref{social.navigation.academia} shows the metrics of articles
we found about social navigation in context of the modern web as captured by
the Web 2.0 term (social network sites, folksonomies, and wikis) and other
areas of computer science (classic web, general user interfaces, security, and
so on).

Our current area of Web 2.0 in relation to navigational problems have in our
view (based on our literature findings) little coverage in academia.
\prequote{beer07}{notes that}{%
 \,`internet time' now runs at at a clock speed several orders
 of magnitude faster than that of academic research}
We described earlier the growth we're seeing of web sites with social
aspects and we believe that some of these provide for novel examples of social
navigation. It would therefore be interesting to look at some of the
state-of-the-art social web sites and look at what contributions they have
made to the field of social navigation.

\section{Objective}

We'll first try to give an overview of the disparate field of social
navigation as found in academic literature. Here we'll look at what social
navigation is, different characteristics of social navigation, and finally
provide an overview of different types of social navigation.

Based on the concepts we introduce in this overview of social navigation we'll
collect examples of social navigational implementations in the wild
and analyzing them. In doing this we hope to give a clearer
view of how social navigation is used in the Social Web.
As we are unaware of any established technique for
conducting such a study on real world navigation systems we create our own
method as we go\dash{}fine tuning it as we learn from our experiences.

We try to improve an existing web site by implementing a navigational
prototype using the knowledge we gained from collecting social navigation
examples from real world web sites.
The navigational technique we
decided on implementing is a so called \term{activity stream}.%
\sidenote{
  See
  \sectionref{analysis.facebook.news.feed} and
  \sectionref{implementation.design.activity.stream}
  for more information about this particular social navigation technique.
}

The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation's joint
\abbr{TV}, radio, and internet project \project{\urort{}}\dash{}a site where
artists upload their demos and get valuable playtime on radio and \abbr{TV} if
their products are judged to be of sufficient quality\dash{}was
the candidate for implementing a navigational prototype.
Our focus was on the \urort{} web community%
\sidenote{
  Available at \url{http://nrk.no/urort}.
}
where users can interact in a social manner, listen to other people's songs,
and upload their own creations.

We decided to build our application in an unobtrusive manner on top of the
web site \urort{} offered.%
\sidenote{
  The rationale for such a decision can be found in
  \sectionref{implementation.building.on.top.of.the.web}.
}
Based on our prototypical implementation of an activity stream for \urort{}
we'll provide a discussion of the technical feasibility of such an approach.

With our technical solution in place we were able to test how it performed in
practice by conducting an empirical study with real world users. The insights
into activity streams as a social navigation technique will be shared, as well
as our experience with providing our technical prototype solution to real world
users.

\section{Contributions}

Contributions from our research on social navigation is threefold:

\begin{enum}
  \item Informing navigational design by giving a structured overview of
    various social navigational schemes used in academia and the real world.
  \item Exemplifying transparent prototyping methods by sharing experiences
    with creating an unobtrusive shell of navigational designs on top of an
    existing web site.
  \item Applicability of a activity streams as a particular social navigation
    technique by discussing findings from an experiment of its real world
    usage.
\end{enum}

\section{Outline}

This thesis is composed of two parts:

\begin{enum}
  \iterm{Social Navigation on the Social Web}. In this part we first give you
    background information about social navigation before
    we analyze social navigation in two modern social web sites.
  \iterm{Unobtrusive Prototype of Social Navigation}. The second part starts
    with an account of how we created an unobtrusive social navigation
    prototype before we go through an empirical study of the prototype
    implementation.
\end{enum}

After these two parts we conclude our work and give pointers to future work
in \chapterref{conclusion}.
