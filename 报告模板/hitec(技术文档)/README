This is the HITEC class. As the name implies, it is intended
for use on technical documents in hi-tec companies.

It is based upon the article class, but it looks VERY different.
In fact, one of the design aims was to escape the academic look
of the well-known LaTeX document classes.

This is a beta version, which means that it works wonderfully
for me, and on papers I've downloaded from the web. I believe
it's perfectly useful, but it hasn't been widely tested yet.

This is my first and probably last time I deal with document
classes. I'll be glad to receive bug reports, even though I
can't promise to correct them (TeX isn't that easy to deal with).

I'll also be glad to receive comments regarding bad TeX
style or inconsistencies.
