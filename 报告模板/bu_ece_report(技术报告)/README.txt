This is an ECE Technical Report template for LaTeX/BiBTeX typesetting environment. It has been tested with TeTex on Linux and with MiKTeX on Windows. It has not been tested on a Mac.

The package specifies report style (either generic report style with chapters or article style with sections) to assure uniformity among reports from
different authors. It also defines a cover page formatted to fit the cutout in BU report cardboard covers. This makes for a nice bound copy of a report.

In order to get your technical report number, contact the administrative secretary of the Department Chair (PHO324), and provide him/her with report
title and authors. However, please note that the department does not maintain a repository of past technical reports; only report title, author names and report number are archived.

The following files are included in the package:

  report.tex     	 : LaTeX template for a report,
  bu_ece_report.sty	 : BU ECE technical report LaTeX style file,
  fancybox.sty           : fancy box style file for the title-box page,
  fancyheadings.sty      : fancy headings style file for advanced headings,
  BUlogo_cmyk.eps 	 : BU logo as EPS file (cmyk red),
  ieeetr.bst       	 : unsorted IEEE BiBTeX style file,
  ieeetrsrt.bst   	 : sorted IEEE BiBTeX style file.

report.tex file is a template LaTeX file that is suggested as a starting point for the preparation of a BU ECE technical report (report.bbl is needed
for the compilation of report.tex).

The .sty files (bu_ece_report.sty, fancybox.sty, fancyheadings.sty) specify the BU ECE report style.

The .bst files (ieeetr.bst, ieeetrsrt.bst) define IEEE unsorted and sorted, respectively, bibliography styles that are recommended for BU ECE technical reports.
