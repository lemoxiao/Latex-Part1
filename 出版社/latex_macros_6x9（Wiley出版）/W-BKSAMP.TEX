The era of modern \index{microelectronics}\index{microelectronics!modern} 
began in 1958 with the invention of the
integrated circuit by J.~S.~Kilby
 of Texas Instruments \cite{kilby}.
His first chip is shown in Fig.~I. For comparison,
Fig.~I.2 shows a modern microprocessor chip, \cite{beren}.

The command \verb+\sidebyside{}{}+ works similarly for tables:

 \begin{table}[ht]

}
 \end{table}


When using \verb+\sidebyside+, one must
use the cross referencing command \verb+\label{}+ after and  {\it outside} 
 of \verb+\caption{}+:

\begin{verbatim}
 \begin{table} 
 \sidebyside{\caption{Table Caption}\label{tab1}
 first table}
 {\caption{Table Caption}\label{tab2} second table}
 \end{table}
\end{verbatim}
 or,
\begin{verbatim}
 \begin{figure} 
 \sidebyside{\vskip<dimen>\caption{fig caption}\label{fig1}}
 {\vskip<dimen>\caption{fig caption}\label{fig2}}
 \end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
