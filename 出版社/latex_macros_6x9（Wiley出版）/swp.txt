Using Wiley Monograph Book style with Scientific Word and Workplace 5.5
=======================================================================

Concise explanation of how to use wileysix.cls with SWP
   SWP.txt, this file   

The basic w-book style files, identical to that used outside of SWP.
   wileysix.cls 
   wileysev.cls        

Shell files used by SWP
   wileysix.shl 
   wileysev.shl        

Step 1:
===============================
(assuming that your base SWP directory is \swp55. If not,
please substitute your own base directory name)

Drop these files into appropriate directories:

Drop these files into directory \swp55\shells\books\sw 
   wileysix.shl
   wileysev.shl  

If your base SWP directory is other than swp55, please
edit the shl file and replace instances of swp55 with
the correct name of your base SWP directory.

Drop these files into your base directory SWP directory, \swp55
(or where ever your base SWP directory is located)

  wileySix.cls
  wileySev.cls


Step 2: Setting Defaults in SWP
===============================
Start Scientific Workplace, then

Under Tools
  ==>> User Setup ==> Files
         In the Open Type: bring up-- LaTeX(*.tex)  
         In the Save As Type: bring up-- Portable LaTeX(*.tex)  
   Click OK

Documentation and Sample file:
==============================
Documentation, explaining available commands and
how to use them, see w-bkdocs.pdf

Short form: readme.txt

View sample pages with Acrobat: w-bksamp.pdf,
the typeset version of w-bksamp.tex. See w-bksamp.tex
to see the commands needed and how they were used.

You will see references in the documentation to both font
issues and the use of the template file. 

1) Fonts. Don't worry about fonts as you make your book
in SWP. After you are finished, you can save your book
as "portable latex" and then run LaTeX on your book outside
of Scientific Word. At this time you can use w-bookps.sty
(\usepackage{w-bookps})

2) Template file-- When you start your SWP document, you use
wileysix.shl or wileysev.shl. This is not a template file, so
you will have to check the documentation and sample pages
to see the Wiley commands that you will need to enter.

Starting Your Book
==================
To start your document,

In the File menu, click New
When the New window pops up, 
   under Shell Directories: highlight Books
   under Shell Files: highlight wileysix or wileysev
   Click OK

Use `Save as' under the File menu, to give this file the name you want.

Try doing Preview immediately. If you get error messages,
please check 

1. To see if you dropped wileysix.cls or wileysev.cls
into the base SWP directory. 

2. If you base SWP directory is other than swp55, please
edit your .shl file to replace swp55 with the directory
name where SWP is located.


Entering LaTeX Commands in Body of your Document
================================================
Although you can pick many commands from the Tag menu and
thus don't have to type them in, there are some commands
that are included in the wileysix.cls or wileysev.cls files that are not
found on that menu. In addition there may be other circumstances
in which you would like to enter a \LaTeX\ command, i.e., 
\setcounter{page}{<number>} 

In SWP, you are not allowed to simply type \LaTeX\ commands into your file. 
To include LaTeX commands, at the place in your text where you
would like to use them:

Click on the Insert button, 
go to "Typeset Object" then to "TeX Field"

A window will open where you can enter LaTeX commands.

See docs.pdf and w-bksamp.pdf for information on Wiley commands.

Fonts
=====
If you follow the directions above, your book will be typeset using
ComputerModern fonts.

If you would like to use PostScript fonts, which will give your book
a professional appearance, you should run \LaTeX on your files
outside of ScientificWord/Workplace. Fortunately, when
using SWP, you can save your files in a form (Portable LaTeX File) 
that will be understood by any standard \LaTeX system.

To rerun your file produced with SWP, you need to do two things:

-- Type in \usepackage{w-bookps}

ie,
\documentclass{w-book}
\usepackage{w-bookps}

You can edit the w-bookps.sty file if the font names don't
match those on your system. This is not likely to be needed.

Your .tex file is then ready to run with \LaTeX outside of SWP in order
to produce your book with PS fonts.
